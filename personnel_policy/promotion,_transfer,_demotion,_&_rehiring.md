## Promotion, Transfer, Demotion, &amp; Rehiring {#promotion-transfer-demotion-rehiring}

### 6.1 Promotion from Within {#6-1-promotion-from-within}

It is the City’s policy to promote from within whenever management believes a current employee has the requisite skill and ability to perform effectively in a vacant position. The City may, however, in its sole discretion, elect to look outside the City to fill a particular position without considering current employees. Employees who desire a change of position should discuss the matter with their Department Head and submit an application to the Human Resources Department.

### 6.2 Transfers {#6-2-transfers}

Under certain circumstances, non-promotional reassignments (“lateral transfers”) may be approved if determined by management to be in the best interests of the City and/or the employee. Transfers may be initiated by either the employee or the City and normally occur in response to the business needs of the City and/or other extenuating circumstances. Lateral transfers are usually reassignments from one position to another of comparable duties and salary.

### 6.3 Demotion {#6-3-demotion}

An employee may be demoted from a position in one classification range to a position of another classification range. A demotion may result from an unfavorable performance evaluation, a transfer, or as a result of a disciplinary action.

### 6.4 Rehires {#6-4-rehires}

Employees who leave the City’s employment but are rehired within six months will not have a break in service for purposes of vacation and sick leave accrual.
