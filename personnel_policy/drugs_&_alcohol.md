### 9.1 Drug and Alcohol Use {#9-1-drug-and-alcohol-use}

It is the City’s desire to provide a drug-free, healthful, and safe workplace. To promote this goal, employees are required to report to work in appropriate mental and physical condition to perform their jobs in a satisfactory manner.

**Prohibition Against Alcohol and Illegal and Unauthorized Drugs.** While on City premises, while on duty, while conducting City-related business or other activities off premises, while driving a City vehicle, or while operating or using other City property or equipment, no employee may use, possess, distribute, sell, or be under the influence of alcohol, inhalants, illegal drugs, including drugs which are legally obtainable but which were not legally obtained, and prescribed or over-the-counter drugs which are not being used as prescribed or as intended by the manufacturer.

This policy does not prohibit the moderate use of alcoholic beverages at city sponsored social functions if such social functions do not involve the use of a city vehicle to or from the event.

**Prohibition Against Illegal and Unauthorized Drug Related Paraphernalia.** This policy also prohibits the use, possession, distribution and sale of drug-related paraphernalia while on City premises, while on duty, while conducting City-related business or other activities off premises, while driving a City vehicle, or while operating or using other City property or equipment. Drug-related paraphernalia includes material and/or equipment designed for use in testing, packaging, storing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling or otherwise introducing illegal or unauthorized drugs into the body.

**Permissive Use of Prescribed and Over-the-Counter Drugs.** The legal use of prescribed and over-the-counter drugs is permitted if it does not impair an employee&#039;s ability to perform the essential functions of the job (or operate the vehicle, property or other equipment) effectively and in a safe manner that does not endanger the employee, citizens or other individuals in the workplace. Examples of impairment include, but are not limited to, drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, or feeling shaky.

Employees are required to notify their supervisor prior to reporting for work if their performance is compromised or diminished from use of prescription or over-the-counter drugs. It is the responsibility of employees to request reassignment to other duties, if needed, for the duration of impairment, or to request the use of available leave. Employees who fail to notify their supervisor of such impairment, and who continue to work, may be required to take available leave, or to perform other assignments and may be subject to disciplinary action if supervisory intervention is required.

**Police Department Employees.** Certain City Police Department employees may be required to be in possession of alcohol and/or drugs in carrying out their job duties. Such employees will be exempted from certain portions of this policy under certain limited conditions; these employees will be advised in writing of the specific exemptions applicable to them. Additional guidelines will be established by Police and Fire Department operating procedures. Police officers on under-cover assignments must follow the drug and alcohol guidelines established by their department.

**On-Call Employees.** Employees scheduled to be on-call are expected to be fit for duty upon reporting to work. Any employee scheduled to be on-call who is called out is governed by this policy. Sometimes an employee who is not scheduled to be on-call may nevertheless be called out. If this occurs and the employee called out is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol such that reporting to work would result in a violation of this policy, the employee must so advise the appropriate supervisor on duty prior to reporting for work; the employee will not be required to report to work.

**Mandatory Reporting of Convictions.** Within five calendar days, employees must notify their Department Head, in writing, of any criminal convictions involving drugs or alcohol (including a plea of nolo contendere), if the violation occurred in the workplace, during working hours, while attending to City business or while operating a City vehicle.

**Off-Duty Conduct.** The City may take disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, if an employee’s off-duty use or involvement with drugs or alcohol is damaging to the City’s reputation or business, is inconsistent with the employee’s job duties, or when such off-duty use or involvement adversely affects the employee’s job performance.

**Rehabilitation/Treatment.** It is the City’s desire to assist employees who voluntarily request assistance with their alcohol or drug dependency. For City support and assistance, however, an employee must acknowledge his/her problem and seek and accept counseling and/or rehabilitation before it impairs his/her job performance and/or jeopardizes his/her employment.

Employees with drug or alcohol problems that have not resulted in, and are not the immediate subject of, disciplinary action may request approval to take a one-time leave of absence to participate in a rehabilitation or treatment program. (An employee may not enroll in a rehabilitation or treatment program in lieu of disciplinary action.) The one-time leave of absence may be granted at the City’s sole discretion. Factors considered by the City in deciding whether to grant leave include the length of the employee’s employment with the City, the employee’s prior work and disciplinary history, the employee’s agreement to abstain from the use of the problem substance and follow all other requirements of the rehabilitation/treatment program, the reputation of the program and the likelihood of a successful outcome, the employee’s compliance with City policies, rules, and prohibitions relating to conduct in the workplace, and the resulting hardship on the City due to the employee’s absence.

The cost of any rehabilitation or treatment may be covered under the City’s group health insurance policy. In any case, the employee is responsible for all costs associated with any rehabilitation or treatment program.

During time off for a City-approved rehabilitation or treatment program, the employee must use any available vacation leave, sick leave, compensatory time off, or other accrued paid leave time. If the employee has no paid time off available, the time away from work will be unpaid. Where applicable, any time off for rehabilitation or treatment under this policy will also be designated as leave under the City’s Family and Medical Leave Act policy.

If the employee successfully completes his/her prescribed rehabilitation or treatment, the City will make reasonable efforts to return the employee to his/her prior position or one of similar pay and status. However, employment with the City following a City-approved leave for rehabilitation or treatment is conditioned on the following:

(A) Initial negative test for drugs and/or alcohol before returning to work;

(B) A written release to return to work from the City-approved rehabilitation or treatment facility/program;

(C) Periodic and timely confirmation of the employee’s on-going cooperation and successful participation in any follow up or ongoing counseling, testing, or other treatment required in connection with the City-approved rehabilitation or treatment program, if applicable;

(D) In addition to any testing required in connection with the employee’s ongoing treatment or follow up to treatment, all employees who participate in rehabilitation or treatment under this section will also be required to submit to periodic and/or random testing by the City during the two years following the employee’s return to work following treatment;

(E) The employee’s formal written agreement to abide by the above conditions as well as any other conditions deemed appropriate by the City. The employee must meet with a City representative to discuss the terms of his/her continued employment and sign a formal agreement before returning to work.

**Policy Violations.** Violations of this policy will generally lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment and/or required participation in a substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment program. Employees with questions or concerns about substance dependency or abuse are encouraged to discuss these matters with their supervisor or Department Head to receive assistance or referrals to appropriate resources in the community.

The City may have additional obligations in addressing controlled substances and alcohol abuse for those employees regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The City will ensure that the controlled substance and alcohol testing conforms to US DOT workplace testing requirements.

### 9.2 Drug and Alcohol Testing {#9-2-drug-and-alcohol-testing}

**Types of Tests.** Testing may include one or more of the following: urinalysis, hair testing, breathalyzer, intoxilyzer, or other generally accepted testing procedure.

**Testing of Applicants.** All applicants to whom a conditional offer of employment has been made may be required to submit to testing for alcohol and illegal and unauthorized drugs. A positive test result, refusal to test, or attempts to alter or tamper with a sample or any other part of the test, will render the applicant ineligible for consideration of employment or future employment with the City.

**Testing of Employees.**

(A) Employees will be tested for alcohol and/or illegal and unauthorized drugs after a workplace injury or accident or “near miss,” or when reasonable suspicion exists, or in connection with any required treatment or rehabilitation.

(B) For purposes of this policy, reasonable suspicion is a belief based on articulable observations (e.g., observation of alcohol or drug use, apparent physical state of impairment, incoherent mental state, changes in personal behavior that are otherwise unexplainable, deteriorating work performance that is not attributable to other factors, a work-related accident or injury, wreck or accident in a city vehicle, evidence of possession of substances or objects which appear to be illegal or unauthorized drugs, or drug paraphernalia) sufficient to lead a supervisor to suspect that the employee is under the influence of illegal or unauthorized drugs or alcohol. Supervisors must document the specific, observable facts in support of reasonable suspicion testing (e.g., the who, what, when, where of the employee’s behavior and other symptoms, statements from other employees or third parties, and other evidence supporting the reasonable suspicion testing).

(C) Tests will be paid for by the City. To the extent possible, testing will normally be done during the employee’s normal work time.

(D) Any employee who refuses to be tested, or who attempts to alter or tamper with a sample or any other part of the testing process, will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

(E) A positive test result is a violation of the City’s Drug and Alcohol Use Policy and will likely result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Any employee who is terminated for violation of the City’s Drug and Alcohol Use Policy is ineligible for future employment with the City

(F) Police and Fire Department employees are also subject to departmental rules and regulations regarding illegal and unauthorized drug and alcohol testing, including provisions for random testing.

(G) The City may have additional obligations when testing for controlled substances and alcohol for those employees regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation.

**Testing Procedures.**

(A) All testing must be authorized in advance by the City Administrator. For reasonable suspicion testing, testing may not be authorized without a supervisor’s documentation of the articulable observations which led him or her to suspect that the employee is under the influence of illegal or unauthorized drugs or alcohol. Testing should be arranged as soon as possible after the supervisor’s articulable observations.

(B) If an employee’s conduct resulted in a work place accident, injury or “near miss,” or reasonable suspicion otherwise exists to believe that the employee has violated the City’s Drug and Alcohol Use Policy, the employee will be provided with transportation to the testing facility. A supervisor or other designated City representative may be required to stay with the employee during the testing process. The City may, at its discretion, reassign the employee or put him/her on administrative leave until the test results are received. The City will make arrangements to have the employee transported home after the testing.

(C) All substance abuse testing will be performed by a laboratory or health-care provider chosen by the City. All positive test results will be subject to confirmation testing.

(D) Test results will be maintained in a confidential file separate and apart from the employee’s personnel file. Any medical-related information will be confidential and only accessible by designated City representatives on a need to know basis, including those who have a need to know about necessary restrictions on the work or duties of an employee and any necessary accommodation; first aid and safety personnel when appropriate; government officials; insurance companies as may be necessary to provide health or life insurance to employees; by court order or as otherwise legally mandated; and as necessary to protect the interests of the City.

**Positive Test.** A positive drug and/or alcohol test will likely result in termination.
