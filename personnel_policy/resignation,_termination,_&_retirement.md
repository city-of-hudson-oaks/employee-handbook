## 10. Resignation, Termination, & Retirement {#resignation-termination-retirement}

### 10.1 Resignation {#10-1-resignation}

To resign “in good standing,” the City requires that employees give at least two weeks advance written notice, return all City-issued property, pay all debts owed to the City, and attend an exit interview before terminating their employment so that an orderly transition can be made. Employees who resign in good standing may be eligible to be paid for unused vacation, sick \(as discussed in Section 5.4\) and holiday leave and may be eligible for rehire. Employees who resign are asked to furnish written notice to their supervisor or Department Head, giving the reasons for and the effective date of their resignation. Employees who fail to give a two-week notice will not be paid for unused vacation, sick or holiday leave, and may not be eligible for rehire.

### 10.2 Job Abandonment {#10-2-job-abandonment}

If an employee fails to properly notify the City of his/her absence from work or if an employee is absent without authorization for three or more consecutive days, the City will consider the employee to have abandoned his/her employment, which constitutes a voluntary resignation without notice. Employees resigning in this manner will not be paid for unused vacation or sick leave, and are generally not eligible for rehire. In unusual circumstances, employees resigning in this manner may seek reinstatement. Under this policy, the City Administrator may reinstate an employee who abandoned his or her position only when the employee presents good cause for the absence and failure to timely notify a supervisor.

### 10.3 Return of City Property {#10-3-return-of-city-property}

If an employee fails to return City property upon resignation, termination or retirement, the City may make a payroll deduction from the employee’s final paycheck\(s\) in an amount equal to the value of the property the employee failed to return.

### 10.4 Exit Interviews {#10-4-exit-interviews}

Employees who leave the City are expected to attend an exit interview with the Human Resources Coordinator or another representative designated by the Human Resources Director on or before their last day of work. The purpose of the exit interview is to go over the reason the employee is leaving and to solicit constructive feedback to improve the City.

### 10.5 References {#10-5-references}

All requests for information, including requests for verification of employment and requests for employment references, regarding current and former employees, must be in writing and should be directed to the Human Resources Department.

The City will release only dates of employment and job title to third parties unless the employee or former employee has signed a written authorization to disclose further information about his or her employment, or if such information must be disclosed in accordance with a request pursuant to the Public Information Act. Authorization forms are available from the Human Resources Department.

All employees are expected to strictly abide by the terms and procedures of this policy. An employee who receives a request for information should never make any “off-the-record” statements regarding a current or former employee. Employees who violate this policy may be subject to discipline, up to and including termination.

### 10.6 Separation Pay {#10-6-separation-pay}

Employees who leave the City’s employment will receive all pay to which they are legally entitled. Any debt owed to the City by the employee will be deducted from the employee’s final paycheck\(s\). Employees who leave the City’s employment while in good standing will be paid for unused vacation, sick \(as discussed in Section 5.4\) and holiday time in accordance with those policies. Under any of the following circumstances, an employee will not be considered to leave the City’s employment in good standing: \(1\) resigning employees who do not provide the City with at least a two-week notice; \(2\) employees who fail to return all City-issued property; \(3\) employees who fail to attend an exit interview; \(4\) employees who are terminated for cause as determined in the City’s sole discretion; \(5\) employees who resign in lieu of termination and \(6\) employees who fail to complete probation.

### 10.7 Death of an Employee {#10-7-death-of-an-employee}

Any unpaid compensation, including unused vacation, sick \(as discussed in Section 5.4\) and holiday time, of an employee who dies while employed by the City will be paid to his/her designated beneficiary. If there is no designated beneficiary, payment will be made to the employee’s estate, or as otherwise required by law.

### 10.8 TMRS {#10-8-tmrs}

Employees who leave the City’s employment prior to retirement may request a refund of their portion of their TMRS retirement account, plus earned interest on their contribution. If an employee begins employment with a participating employer without a break in service, the employee can request that the account balance be transferred to the new City.

### 10.9 Long-Term Absence/Termination {#10-9-long-term-absence-termination}

Any employee who is absent from work for more than six consecutive months, for any reason, will be terminated. \(Note: This policy will be administered consistently with the City’s obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, including considering extending leave as a reasonable accommodation.\)

### 10.10 Reduction-in-Force {#10-10-reduction-in-force}

The City Administrator may implement a reduction-in-force at any time because of budget reductions or curtailment of work. A reduction-in-force may require the separation, demotion, reassignment or reduction in work hours of certain employees. A reduction-in-force may impact an entire department, a division within a department or a functional area within a department. Factors that will be considered in determining which employees will be adversely affected by the reduction-in-force may include employees’ unique qualifications, knowledge, and skill; performance evaluations; disciplinary history; and length of service. In all cases, the needs of the City will be paramount. If more than one employee holds the same position within a department as the position that is vacated or abolished, the employee\(s\) with the least seniority shall be separated.
