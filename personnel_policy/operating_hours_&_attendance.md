## Operating Hours &amp; Attendance {#operating-hours-attendance}

### 4.1 Regular Hours {#4-1-regular-hours}

Employees of the City normally work 40 hours in a five-day work week (Monday-Friday). The regular workday begins at 8:00 a.m. and ends at 5:00 p.m., although employees in some departments may have different work hours.

### 4.2 Adjustment to Work Hours {#4-2-adjustment-to-work-hours}

In order to assure the continuity of City services, it may be necessary for Department Heads to establish other operating hours for their departments. Work hours and work shifts must be arranged to provide continuous service to the public. Employees are expected to cooperate when asked to work overtime or a different schedule. Your acceptance of work with the City is your agreement that this will not create an undue hardship on you or your family and that you will be available to do such work.

### 4.3 Meal Periods and Breaks {#4-3-meal-periods-and-breaks}

Full-time employees (excluding most Police Department employees) are normally provided a one-hour unpaid meal break near the middle of the workday. Meal periods may be staggered by your Department Head between the hours of 11:00 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. in order to minimize departmental interruption. Your supervisor will provide you with the starting and ending time for your specific meal period. Employees will be relieved from work responsibilities during unpaid meal breaks. Nonexempt employees must record the beginning and ending times of their meal break. Employees may not extend meal breaks beyond their assigned period.

Full time employees may, depending on individual departmental work schedules and the discretion of their supervisor, take up to two short, paid work breaks each day, one during the first part of the work day and the other during the latter part of the work day. Each such break may not exceed fifteen minutes in length.

### 4.4 Attendance Records {#4-4-attendance-records}

Nonexempt employees are required to record the number of hours worked each day. An exception may be given if alternative record keeping is proposed by the Department Head and approved the City Administrator.

### 4.5 Attendance and Punctuality {#4-5-attendance-and-punctuality}

To maintain a safe and productive work environment, the City expects employees to be reliable and punctual in reporting to work. Absenteeism and tardiness are disruptive and place a burden on the City and on your co-workers. Either may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

In the rare instance when you cannot avoid being late to work or are unable to work as scheduled, you must personally notify your supervisor as soon as possible in advance of the anticipated tardiness or absence. You must disclose to your supervisor the reason for the absence or tardiness and the date/time of your anticipated arrival. For absences of a day or more you must personally notify your supervisor on each day of your absence unless your supervisor expressly waives this requirement. If an employee is unable to contact his/her supervisor, the employee should notify the Human Resources Coordinator giving a phone number where the employee can be reached, the name of his/her supervisor, the reason for the absence, and the probable time that he/she will report to work. Police Department personnel must report their tardiness or absence in accordance with their Departmental rules and regulations.

In most instances, an employee who fails to properly notify his or her supervisor in advance of an absence or tardy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. If an employee is absent from work for three (3) or more consecutive work days without making proper notification, this absence will be considered a voluntary resignation. If such a situation occurs, and the employee later returns to work with documentation proving that such absence was totally beyond his/her control and it was impossible to provide the necessary notification, then reinstatement may be considered.
