## Employee Acknowledgement Form {#employee-acknowledgement-form}

The City of Hudson Oaks \(the “City”\) Employee Handbook, revised **March 24, 2017**, describes important information about the City’s personnel policies and procedures, and I understand that I should consult my supervisor and/or my Department Head regarding any questions not answered in the Employee Handbook. I have entered my employment relationship with the City voluntarily and acknowledge that there is no specified length of employment. Accordingly, either I or the City can terminate the relationship at will, with or without cause, at any time.

Except for the City’s employment-at-will policy, all the information, policies, and benefits described in the Employee Handbook are subject to change. I understand that revised information may supersede, modify, or eliminate existing policies. In the event of a conflict, I understand that the Employee Handbook supersedes all department policies. I agree that any conflicts or ambiguities in City policies and procedures will be decided by the City Administrator.

Furthermore, I acknowledge that this Employee Handbook is neither a contract of employment nor a legal document. I understand that only the City Council has the authority to authorize an employment agreement or contract, and that any such agreement must be an express written employment contract, approved by the City Council in open session at a council meeting, and signed by both the City Administrator and the affected employee.

I have received the Employee Handbook, and I understand that it is my responsibility to read and comply with the policies contained in it and any revisions made to it. I also understand that the policies in this Employee Handbook supersede all prior written and/or oral City policies.
