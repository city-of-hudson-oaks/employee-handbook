## Wage &amp; Salary Policies {#wage-salary-policies}

### 3.1 Employee Compensation Plan {#3-1-employee-compensation-plan}

Subject to approval by the City Council, the City Administrator will prepare and administer a written compensation plan for all City employees. In preparing the compensation plan, consideration will be given to prevailing rates of pay among public and private employers; the duties, responsibilities and qualifications required for the position; and other relevant factors.

### 3.2 Pay Schedule {#3-2-pay-schedule}

The City has 26 pay periods each year and employees will normally be paid every other Wednesday. Employees will normally be paid on the preceding workday if the current payday falls on a recognized holiday. Each paycheck will include earnings for all work performed through the end of the previous payroll period.

All employees will be required to use automatic bank deposit and each employee will receive a pay check stub. When an employee is absent or on leave on payday, the employee must report to their Department Head to receive his or her paycheck stub, or designate a person (in writing) to pick up his or her paycheck stub. The person designated to pick up the paycheck stub must be identified on the appropriate form provided by the City and completed by the employee.

No pay advances or loans will be made by the City to any employee for any reason.

### 3.3 Basis for Annual Compensation {#3-3-basis-for-annual-compensation}

In most instances, employee salaries (other than certain police personnel) are based on a forty-hour work week for fifty-two weeks each year (2080 hours per year). Where regular employment is less than full time (less than 35 hours per week), the employee’s salary will be based on the actual number of hours worked times the hourly rate of pay established for that position. Police personnel’s salaries are based on a forty two-hour work week for fifty two weeks each year (2184 hours per year).

### 3.4 General Overtime Policy {#3-4-general-overtime-policy}

When the City’s operating requirements or other needs cannot be met during regular working hours, employees may be required to work overtime. Overtime compensation is paid to all nonexempt employees in accordance with federal and state wage and hour requirements. In some cases, nonexempt employees may accrue compensatory time in lieu of being paid overtime compensation. (See Compensatory Time Policy below.) Exempt employees are not paid overtime compensation.

When possible, advance notification of mandatory overtime assignments will be provided at department head discretion. Overtime assignments will be distributed as equitably as practical to all nonexempt employees qualified to perform the required work. Refusal or other failure to work mandatory overtime may result in disciplinary action, up to and including, termination of employment. Overtime work is otherwise subject to the same attendance policies as straight time work.

**Overtime Rate.** Overtime pay for nonexempt employees (excluding certain police personnel) is at the rate of 1 ½ times the employee’s regular hourly rate for hours actually worked in excess of 40 in a work week. Overtime for non-exempt police personnel on a 12-hour work cycle is at the rate of 1 ½ times the employee’s regular hourly rate for hours actually worked in excess of 84 in the 14-day work cycle.

**Work Week.** For nonexempt employees the work week is a recurring seven-day period beginning at 12:00 a.m. on Monday and ending at 11:59 p.m. on the following Sunday.

**Work Hours and Reporting Time Worked.** An employee’s specific hours of work may vary depending on his or her position and department. Employees are expected to be at their workstations and ready to work at their scheduled start time. Occasionally, staffing needs and operational demands may necessitate variations in work schedules. Supervisors are responsible for providing employees with a specific schedule. Employees are expected to cooperate when asked to work overtime or a different schedule. It is the responsibility of each employee to sign his or her time card/sheet each pay period to certify the accuracy of all time recorded, including overtime. Supervisors must review and initial the time record before submitting it for processing. If corrections or modifications need to be made to a time record, the employee and the employee’s supervisor must verify the accuracy of the changes and initial the time record. Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records, or recording another employee in or out will result in immediate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

**Prior Authorization Required Before Working Overtime.** All nonexempt employees must receive their supervisor’s and/or Department Head’s prior authorization before performing any overtime work. This means employees may not begin work prior to the start of their scheduled work day, and may not continue working beyond the end of their scheduled workday, without prior authorization from the appropriate supervisor. Similarly, employees may not work through their lunch break without prior authorization from the appropriate supervisor. Employees are responsible for limiting overtime to that which is requested by their supervisor or Department Head. In the case of police department employees, only the Chief (or his/her designee) or the City Administrator may authorize overtime work. On the employee’s time card/sheet, the appropriate supervisor must also approve any overtime before the time card/sheet is submitted for processing and payment. Nonexempt employees who work overtime without receiving proper authorization will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment.

Overtime is budgeted annually by the City Council. Supervisors and Department Heads are responsible for insuring that employees do not work any unauthorized overtime. The City Administrator must approve all overtime that exceeds a department’s budgeted amount.

### 3.5 Non-Statutory Compensatory Time for Exempt Employees {#3-5-non-statutory-compensatory-time-for-exempt-employees}

Exempt employees receive an annual salary for the performance of services regardless of the number of hours worked. The City has no legal obligation to pay its exempt employees overtime or to provide them with “comp time.” The City Administrator may, however, from time to time, approve non-statutory compensatory time off when exceptional circumstances require an exempt employee to put in a significant amount of time in excess of 40 hours in a work week. In these instances, equivalent time off on a straight time basis may be permitted, but only if the work schedule permits and such time is approved in advance by the City Administrator and the employee’s Department Head. Comp. time must be taken within the same pay period that it is granted.

Non-statutory compensatory time should not be authorized for additional hours worked that are typical, expected, and frequently required for all managerial and professional jobs in order to meet responsibilities. It should not be authorized for occasional overtime work or for extended but clearly limited periods of additional work that are common to most departments. Nor should it be authorized if an employee chooses to work through lunch periods, to come in early or to leave late, either occasionally or consistently.

### 3.6 Payroll Deductions {#3-6-payroll-deductions}

In addition to their paycheck, employees will receive a statement showing gross pay, deductions and net pay. Some payroll deductions are required by law, e.g., federal income tax withholding, and court ordered child support. Employees may elect to have certain other deductions made from their pay (e.g., insurance premiums) if they authorize the deductions in writing. Deductions other than those specifically authorized by the City Administrator and Department Head are not permitted.

In the unlikely event that there is an error in the amount of a deduction, or any other payroll error, you should let your supervisor know as soon as possible. At the end of each calendar year, you will be given a Wage and Tax Statement Form (W-2). This statement summarizes your income and deductions for the year.

### 3.7 Automatic Bank Deposits {#3-7-automatic-bank-deposits}

All City employees will be required to have automatic bank deposit. If the employee does not have a bank account that has this service, a temporary exception will be given for two pay periods. During this exception period the employee will receive their payroll check from their Department Head on the scheduled payroll date. If you have any questions or trouble with this process, contact the Human Resources Coordinator.

### 3.8 Time Keeping {#3-8-time-keeping}

Federal and State laws require the City to keep an accurate record of the time worked by all nonexempt employees. Accordingly, accurately recording time worked is the responsibility of every employee. Time worked is all the time actually spent on the job performing assigned duties. Nonexempt employees must accurately record the time they begin and end their workday, as well as the beginning and ending time of each meal period. Nonexempt employees may not begin working prior to their scheduled start time without prior approval from their supervisor. They must also record the beginning and ending time of any split shift, break or departure from work for personal reasons. Overtime work must always be approved before it is performed.

It is the employee&#039;s responsibility to sign his or her time sheet each pay period to certify the accuracy of all time recorded. The employee’s supervisor will review and then initial the time record before submitting it for payroll processing. If corrections or modifications need to be made to an employee’s time record, the employee and his/her supervisor must verify the accuracy of the changes and initial the time record. Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records, or recording another employee in or out will result in immediate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### 3.9 On-Call and Callback {#3-9-on-call-and-callback}

The City provides for after-hour service needs when required by allowing some departmental operations to designate nonexempt employees to be on-call. Certain exempt personnel may also be designated as on-call. Employees designated to be on-call are expected to respond to departmental after-hour service needs as required by procedures established by each Department where on-call personnel are utilized.

**Call back.** During all time after regularly scheduled working hours when an employee has been designated to be available for on-call and subject to call back, the employee is free to pursue personal activities but may be requested to respond to call back (via paging, phone, or radio) within designated guidelines set by the Department. This on-call status is not considered time worked and is not compensable unless the employee responds to a call back. All employees designated to be on-call are expected to be fit (mentally and physically) to accomplish services needed within the time frame required.

Each Department shall establish internal procedures for handling emergency services which could require call back of all employees necessary to provide the needed service, regardless of on-call status. An employee will be considered officially scheduled and designated as on-call only when approved by his/her supervisor in accordance with procedures established by his/her Department.

**Compensation.** Nonexempt employees will be paid fifty dollars ($50.00) for each week they are on call. In addition, Nonexempt employees who are called back during their on-call status to the workplace will be paid at their regular rate of pay for actual hours worked, until overtime requirements are met. Time worked immediately after regularly scheduled working hours at the request or approval of the supervisor will not be considered call-back and will be paid at the regular rate of pay until overtime requirements are met.

Employees exempt from overtime compensation are not eligible for compensation under the provisions of this section.

### 3.10 Temporary Assignment Pay {#3-10-temporary-assignment-pay}

Employees temporarily assigned to perform duties of a higher-level position for the purpose of learning the position or as on-the-job training, will not be compensated at a higher rate of pay. However, when designated by a Department Head or the City Administrator, employees temporarily directed to perform the additional duties and responsibilities of a higher-level position for more than one pay period will be paid at the base rate of the higher-level position or five percent (5%) above their current salary, whichever is greater.

A payroll status change form must be completed for all employees designated to serve in a Temporary Assignment position and approved by the appropriate supervisor and forwarded to the Human Resources Department for processing.

### 3.11 LONGEVITY PAY {#3-11-longevity-pay}

All full-time employees employed for one year or more shall receive longevity pay in addition to their regular base pay in accordance with the schedule in Section (A).

(A) Rates; Eligibility. All regular full-time employees of the City shall receive longevity pay in addition to their regular base pay in accordance with the following schedule:

$4/month for each year of service, up to a maximum of one thousand four hundred forty dollars ($1,440.00) for thirty (30) years of full-time City service.

(B) Establishment of Eligibility. The date on which an employee must have completed the appropriate years of service is September 30\. For the employee’s time employed to be counted for purposes of calculating his/her years of service for longevity, the employee must have been in the continuous, regular full-time employ of the City for the entire period. Employees incurring a leave without pay of greater than one (1) normal workday within any month shall not be in continuous regular full-time employ of the City for that month, except as may otherwise be required by law.

To receive payment hereunder, the employee must be in a regular status with the City the month in which the payment is actually made.

(C) Continuity of Service – Exceptions.

(i) Continuity of service in the City’s employee shall not be interrupted because of absence due to compulsory military service or due to voluntary military service in the armed forces of the United States of America in accordance with personnel policies and procedures, and all such time spent in the armed forces of the United States of America shall apply toward accrued service for longevity pay.

(ii) Continuity of service in the City’s employ shall not be interrupted because of absence when such absence shall have been granted in accordance with the appropriate personnel procedures (i.e. worker’s comp injury). None of such time on an approved leave without pay shall apply toward the employee’s service credit for determining longevity pay unless the absence was for military leave as provided in subsection A above.

(D) Separation from Service. In the event any eligible officer or employee dies, retires, or is separated from the service of the City in good standing on any day other than the date on which longevity pay is distributed, he/she is not entitled to receive longevity pay.

(E) The provisions of this policy and the payments authorized hereby shall apply prospectively only.
