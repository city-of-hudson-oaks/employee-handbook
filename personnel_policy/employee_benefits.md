## 5. Employee Benefits {#employee-benefits}

### 5.1 Overview {#5-1-overview}

Benefit eligibility is dependent upon a variety of factors, including employee classification and length of service. Generally, however, regular full-time employees are eligible for most benefits, and regular part-time employees are eligible for certain benefits on a _pro rata_ basis. Part-time and temporary employees are generally not eligible for City benefits. Contact your supervisor, Department Head, or the Human Resources Coordinator to obtain information regarding the benefits you for which you may be eligible.

Benefit programs available to eligible employees include, but are not limited to:

* Deferred Compensation
* Paid Holidays
* Bereavement Leave 
* Paid Jury Duty Leave
* Paid Witness Duty Leave
* Deferred Compensation 
* Paid Sick Leave
* Military Leave 
* Paid Vacation Leave
* Time Off to Vote
* Workers’ Compensation Benefit 
* TMRS Contributions
* Family and Medical Leave Act Leave
* Free Checking at City Depository 
* Group Life and Accident Insurance
* Group Health Insurance 
* Group Dental Insurance
* Cafeteria Plans

While the City pays the full cost of most of these benefits, some of the benefit programs require contributions from participating employees.

### 5.2 Paid Vacation Leave {#5-2-paid-vacation-leave}

Vacation leave accrues for each pay period that an eligible employee is in a pay status for at least half the standard number of paid days for that pay period.

**Accrual Rate \(Except for Eighty-four hour Police Employees\).** Regular employees begin accruing paid vacation leave during their first full pay period of employment. Regular full- time employees accrue vacation leave as follows:

| Years of Service | Rate of Accrual |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1-5 | 80 hours per year \(3.08 per pay period\) |
| 6-15 | 120 hours per year \(4.62 per pay period\) |
| 16+ | 160 hours per year \(6.15 per pay period\) |

Regular part-time employees and temporary and seasonal employees do not accrue vacation leave. An employee’s “Years of Service” may be adjusted for any significant leave of absence, except military leave.

**Accrual Rate for Police Employees.** During their first full pay period of employment, police personnel performing 12-hour shift work on a regular basis begin earning vacation leave in accordance with the following schedule:

| Years of Service | Rate of Accrual |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1-5 | 84 hours per year \(3.23 per pay period\) |
| 6.15 | 126 hours per year \(4.85 per pay period\) |
| 16+ | 168 hours per year \(6.46 per pay period\) |

An employee’s “Years of Service” may be adjusted for any significant leave of absence, except military leave.

**Personal Time.** Regular Employees, starting January 1st of each year, will receive 16 hours of personal time. Police Employees, starting October 1st of each year will receive 24 hours of personal time.

**Maximum Accruals.** It is the policy of the City that vacation should be taken annually in the year earned. If vacation leave is not taken, all accrued vacation leave in excess of 240 hours will be forfeited after September 30th of each year for all employees. However, no employee shall lose accrued vacation leave because of “work urgency”. “Work urgency” is defined as the Department's need to have the employee at work to perform duty assignments for a specified period of time. If an employee has reached the maximum allowed unused balance and is unable to take vacation leave due to work urgency, injury, extended medical leave, or special or pre-scheduled authorized leave, the Department Head will approve an extension of time to allow the employee a period not to exceed six months to use accrued vacation leave in excess of the maximum allowed unused balance. Documentation of the approval will be placed in the employee’s personnel file.

**Scheduling Annual Vacation Leave.** For each vacation hour used, one hour will be deducted from the employee’s accrued vacation leave. Vacation leave must be taken in minimum increments of one hour. Department Heads are responsible for scheduling annual vacation leave for employees under their authority. \(Department Head vacations require City Administrator approval.\) Whenever possible, vacation leave will be scheduled at the convenience of employees. However, Department Heads must be certain that vacations do not interfere with the normal functions and activities of department operations. Whenever possible, employees are encouraged to submit their preferred vacation schedule to the appropriate supervisor as far in advance as possible to relieve any scheduling problems that may develop.

**Compensation for Leave Time.** Vacation leave is paid at the employee’s base pay rate at the time of vacation. Vacation leave will be paid only for time that the employee would ordinarily have worked. Vacation leave is not considered time worked for purposes of calculating overtime payments. To ensure proper payment of vacation leave pay, employees must make sure they have an approved written vacation request on file before leaving for vacation.

Employees may not “borrow” unearned vacation time. From time to time, with approval from the City Council, the City Administrator may institute a temporary vacation buy-back program.

Upon termination of employment, employees in good standing \(as defined in Sec. 10.1\) having accrued but unused vacation leave will be paid for that vacation time, up to 160 hours, at their regular hourly rate at the time of termination.

**Probationary Employees.** Newly hired probationary employees are not eligible to take vacation time until they have completed six-months of service with the City. Vacation leave is forfeited if employment is terminated before a Probationary Employee completes six-months of service.

### 5.3 Holidays {#5-3-holidays}

It is the City’s policy to permit as many employees as possible to enjoy a day off without loss of pay on holidays. However, any or all employees may be required to work on a holiday.

**Official Holidays.** The City usually observes the holidays listed below, plus one personal holiday. When a holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the holiday will normally be observed by the City on the day designated by the federal government \(i.e., the Friday before or the Monday following\).

* New Year's Day \(January 1\)
* Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
* Good Friday
* President’s Day
* Memorial Day \(last Monday in May\)
* Independence Day \(July 4\)
* Labor Day \(first Monday in September\)
* Veteran’s Day
* Thanksgiving \(fourth Thursday in November\)
* Day after Thanksgiving
* Christmas Eve Day \(December 24\)
* Christmas \(December 25\)
* Personal Day \(Floating\)

**Holidays During Vacation Leave.** Employees taking vacation that includes an authorized holiday during their paid time off will be paid for the holiday without that day being charged against the employee’s paid vacation time.

**Holiday Rate of Pay \(Except for “Twelve-Hour Shift” Employees of the Police Department\).** Nonexempt employees who work on a holiday will be paid eight hours of holiday pay, plus their regular rate of pay for each hour actually worked. If working on a holiday causes an employee to work overtime for that work week or work cycle, the employee will not be paid both the holiday rate and the overtime rate for the holiday. Exempt employees who work on a holiday will receive a day off with pay at a later date. Regular full-time employees who do not work on a holiday are paid for the number of hours they normally work on the day of the week on which the holiday falls. Regular part-time employees who do not work on a holiday receive holiday pay equal to the number of hours they normally work each day if they are normally scheduled to work on the day of the week on which the holiday falls.

Paid time off for holidays will be counted as hours worked for purposes of determining overtime.

**Eligibility.** Only regular full-time and part-time employees are eligible for paid holidays. To be eligible for holiday pay, nonexempt employees must work their regular schedule immediately before and after the holiday, unless otherwise approved by their Department Head. Employees on a leave of absence without pay the work day before a holiday are ineligible for holiday pay.

**Non-Scheduled Religious Holidays.** You may request an approved absence to celebrate a religious holiday that is not a scheduled City holiday. Time off for such absences may be taken as vacation, compensatory time, a personal holiday, an excused absence without pay, or may be exchanged for working on one of the City’s designated holidays without receiving holiday pay.

### 5.4 Sick Leave {#5-4-sick-leave}

**Eligibility.** All regular full-time employees begin accruing paid sick leave during their first full pay period of employment. Part-time, Temporary and seasonal employees do not accrue sick leave. Employees who have not yet completed six months of probationary service are ineligible to use accrued sick leave.

**Accrual Rate \(Except for Employees of the Police Department\).** For full-time regular employees, sick leave typically accrues based on an 8-hour day, at the rate of 3.07 hours per pay period. Sick leave does not accrue when an employee is in a leave without pay status for more than half the pay period or when an employee receives workers’ compensation pay benefits for the full pay period. Regular part-time employees accrue sick leave on a pro rata basis.

**Accrual Rate for Employees of the Police Department.** Twelve-hour shift employees accrue sick leave based on a 12-hour day, at the rate of 3.23 hours per pay period. Sick leave does not accrue during a pay period in which an employee is in a leave without pay status for more than half the employee’s workdays in the pay period or when an employee receives workers’ compensation pay benefits for the full pay period.

**Authorized Use of Sick Leave.** Accrued sick leave may be used for absences due to the employee’s personal illness, accident or injury, or absences when the employee is needed to care for a member of his or her immediate family who is ill and who resides in the employee’s house. Sick leave may also be used by employees for doctor and dentist appointments.

Employees who are unable to work due to illness or injury must immediately notify the appropriate supervisor in accordance with the procedures adopted by their Department Director.

Sick leave must be taken in minimum one-hour increments.

Sick leave may not be used if the illness, accident, or injury is acquired as a result of other employment.

**Failure to Report Absence/Abuse of Sick Leave.** Abuse of sick leave, including use of sick leave for anything other than as provided for in this policy, will likely result in immediate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and may also render the employee ineligible for paid sick leave benefits. Similarly, employees who fail to timely report an absence or tardiness due to illness or injury may be disqualified from using sick leave for their absence. Employees on sick leave, whether paid or unpaid, may not work a second job \(whether paid or voluntary\) during the period of leave.

**Use of Other Leave.** If approved by the Department Head \(and in the case of Department Heads, by the City Administrator\), accrued vacation leave, compensatory time off, other accrued paid leave, or leave of absence without pay may be used if an employee has no accrued sick leave time.

Official holidays observed by the City while an employee is on approved paid sick leave will be treated as a holiday under the City’s Holiday Policy.

An employee who qualifies for use of sick leave during a scheduled vacation leave may be permitted to use sick leave instead of vacation leave for a qualifying absence. In such an instance, the employee must notify his or her supervisor immediately rather than waiting until the employee returns to work. Supporting documentation will be required in such cases.

**Abuse of Sick Leave.** Employees are encouraged to use their sick leave when they are ill. This ensures the employees recover and also prevents the spread of germs in the work place. Employees are also encouraged to use good judgment when taking sick leave. An employee may be required to present satisfactory proof of illness/injury whenever he/she uses sick leave if the supervisor feels sick leave is being over used or there is reason to believe sick leave is not being used properly. If the employee fails to present such proof in a timely manner, use of sick leave will be disallowed and no other paid leave may be used for the absence. Abuse of sick leave may result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment.

**Family and Medical Leave Act Leave.** Any absence which qualifies for both Family and Medical Leave Act leave and sick leave will be counted as both.

**Payment for Unused Sick Leave.** Employees who terminate employment in good standing and have not been terminated for disciplinary reasons are eligible to receive compensation for a portion of their accrued sick leave. No compensation will be paid unless the employee has accrued sick leave of a minimum of 101 hours, then compensation will be calculated as a percent of the employee’s regular hourly rate as listed below, rounded to the nearest hour.

**Accrued Sick Leave Compensation.**

| Hours | % Hourly Rate |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0-100 | 0 |
| 101-200 | 20 |
| 201-300 | 30 |
| 301-400 | 40 |
| 401-500 | 50 |
| 501-600 | 60 |

Using the accrued sick leave compensation schedule, an employee with 210 accrued sick leave hours would be paid 30 percent of their hourly rate for those 210 hours upon separation from employment. The maximum sick leave payment would be 60 percent of an employee’s hourly rate times 600 hours unless specified differently in the City Ordinance or employment agreement.

### 5.5 Sick Leave Sharing {#5-5-sick-leave-sharing}

This policy establishes a Sick Leave Pool to provide additional sick leave for eligible employees who have exhausted all paid leave and suffered a loss of compensation because of a catastrophic illness or injury of the employee or a member of the employee’s immediate family.

   1. The Certification of Physician or Practitioner must be signed by a licensed medical practitioner, as defined in the Texas Insurance Code, who is practicing within the scope of his/her license.
   2. The Certification of Physician or Practitioner must include the date the medical condition began and the probable duration, the estimate of time that the employee will be unable to perform work of any kind or whether it is necessary for the employee to work a reduced schedule.
2. A renewal application form and physician certification form must be filled out and signed by a physician every 30 calendar days that the employee is eligible for and requires the use of Pool leave.
3. If the employee is incapacitated so that he/she cannot provide the application and/or physician’s certification, an employee spokesperson \(family member, physician or another employee\) may provide this to the City.

**Hour Disbursement Details**

1. An employee can request up to 240 hours of donated sick at a time.
2. Should the employee need additional hours of donated leave, the employee, or a representative, may approach the City Administrator to request up to an additional 240 hours. At that time, the employee, or representative, must present the Administrator with a physician’s certification stating when the employee will be able to return to work. Any additional hours must be approved by the City Administrator before they are withdrawn from the Sick Leave Pool.

**Approval Process**

1. The City Administrator will review all applications and certifications for use of Sick Leave Pool time. In determining the amount of sick leave to be awarded to an eligible employee from the Pool, the Administrator shall take into consideration the information contained in the employee's application, the number of applications then pending, and the amount of sick leave available in the Pool. In no event shall the sick leave allocated to an eligible employee from the Pool exceed two-third \(2/3\) of the Sick Leave Pool balance.
2. Application for Pool leave is on a first-come, first-served basis and is contingent upon the available balance in the Pool at the time of application as well as the employee’s ability to meet the criteria listed in Section II \(C\).

4. The lifetime maximum that can be received by any employee is 720 hours.
5. Five working days from submission of the appropriate application and documentation to the Human Resource Department, a decision will be returned in writing.

**Use of Sick Leave Pool Days**

1. An employee may use sick leave assigned from the Pool in the same manner as sick leave accrued pursuant to the Personnel Policies and shall be treated in the same manner and shall be entitled to accrue the same benefits as an employee who uses such accrued sick leave. However, as soon as leave is accrued, earned paid time will be used in lieu of the contributed time from the Pool.
2. Employee and City contributions to insurance, retirement, etc. will continue while the employee is on Sick Leave Pool time.
3. When an employee returns to work after using Sick Leave Pool time and their anniversary date fell during the period of leave, the annual merit/step increase will not be awarded until 30 calendar days after the employee initially returned to work. The merit/step increase will be awarded at this time even if the employee’s return to work after the anniversary date is on an intermittent or reduced scheduled, so long as the employee receives a passing score on the performance evaluation. This delay will not alter the employee’s anniversary date in subsequent years. Periods of absence covered by FMLA will not delay anniversary merit/step increases.
4. While out on Pool time, any across the board salary increases, COLA’s, market adjustments, etc., which are independent of performance, will be awarded to the employee.
5. While out on Pool time, employees will not be permitted to perform outside work for compensation prior to returning from Pool leave and working his/her scheduled shift. Employees found to be in conflict with this policy will be subject to the loss of the paid leave time, will lose all remaining Sick Leave Pool time and will be subject to disciplinary action, including termination.
6. When the employee is absent from work because of a catastrophic illness or injury, prior to the employee's return to work, the employee must submit to the Human Resources Department a licensed health care provider’s written statement that the employee was required to be absent from duty because of the condition and the date that the employee is able to return to work. The statement must also specify what limitations, if any, exist to the employee's ability to perform his or her job duties or pose a threat to the safety of the employee or others.
7. If the employee’s health care provider releases the employee to return to work before the end of the approved Sick Leave Pool period, the employee must notify their supervisor and the Human Resources Department and make arrangements to return to work as soon as possible.
8. If a member withdraws sick leave hours from the Sick Leave Pool and is certified by his/her health care provider to return to work before all the sick leave hours have been used, the remaining balance of awarded and unused sick leave hours will be returned to the Sick Leave Pool.

**Property Rights**

No property rights or entitlements exist to sick leave contributions provided by this policy or any previous individual donations of sick leave.

The estate of a deceased employee shall not be entitled to payment for unused sick leave assigned from the Pool.

Awards from the pool are prospective. State law prohibits the retroactive granting of sick leave or Sick Leave Pool hours. Employees who have exhausted all accrued paid leave will be put on leave without pay until a Sick Leave Pool award, if any, is approved.

The City reserves the right to change modify, amend, revoke or rescind all or part of this policy at the discretion of the City Council.

### 5.6 Maternity/Paternity Leave {#5-6-maternity-paternity-leave}

Regular full-time employees shall be eligible for up to 6 weeks of paid maternity leave or 2 weeks of paid paternity leave. Approved leave under this section:

1. Shall be available for the birth of a child as well as the adoption of a child;
2. Must be communicated in writing to the Department Head or City Administrator in advance, such that appropriate plans can be made in advance of the employee's absence;
3. May begin prior to the birth of a child should a doctor require that the employee refrain from working. The employee wishing to take early leave should provide documentation to that effect prior to the commencement of leave time, unless extenuating circumstances make prior notice impracticable;
4. Shall be limited to the time periods stated above during the course of a two-year period which shall begin at the commencement of leave.
   1. For example, if the 6-week maternity leave begins on July 1 of the current year, the employee will not be eligible for leave under this section until July 1 two years later.

Maternity and Paternity shall be defined under the provisions of the FMLA.

### 5.7 Bereavement Leave {#5-7-bereavement-leave}

Upon approval of the Department Head, up to five working days of paid leave per fiscal year may be provided to regular full and regular part-time employees to allow the employee to attend the funeral and make any necessary arrangements associated with the death of an immediate family member.

An employee who wishes to take bereavement leave must notify his or her supervisor as soon as possible so that arrangements can be made to accommodate the employee’s absence. Employees may, with their supervisor's approval, use any available paid vacation leave and/or compensatory time for additional time off as necessary.

The City may require proof of death/funeral in support of bereavement leave. Bereavement leave pay is paid at the employee’s base rate at the time of absence. It does not include overtime. Paid time off for bereavement leave is not counted as hours worked for purposes of determining overtime.

### 5.8 Jury Duty Leave {#5-8-jury-duty-leave}

The City encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by serving on jury duty when required. Accordingly, regular full-time and part-time employees will be paid their normal earnings for time spent serving on a jury. Jury duty leave is paid at the employee’s base pay rate at the time of jury duty and does not include overtime. Paid time off for jury duty is not counted as hours worked for purposes of determining overtime. Employees must show their jury duty summons to their supervisor as soon as possible so that arrangements can be made to accommodate their absence. The employee may keep any jury fees paid for jury duty. Employees are expected to report to work whenever the court’s schedule permits.

### 5.9 Witness Duty Leave {#5-9-witness-duty-leave}

The City encourages employees to appear in court for witness duty when subpoenaed to do so. If employees have been subpoenaed or otherwise requested to testify as witnesses by the City, it will be considered part of their job duties and treated as hours worked.

When employees are requested or subpoenaed to testify in court by a party other than the City, they may use any available paid vacation, holiday or compensatory leave for this absence. If the employee has no available vacation, holiday or compensatory leave time, any time off for witness duty will be unpaid.

A subpoena for witness duty must be shown to the employee’s supervisor immediately after it is received so that employee staffing can be adjusted, where necessary, to accommodate the employee’s absence. The employee is expected to report for work whenever the court’s schedule permits.

### 5.10 Time Off to Vote {#5-10-time-off-to-vote}

Employees are encouraged to exercise their right to vote in national, state, or municipal elections; however, employees are expected to vote during their non-working hours. If an employee needs additional time to vote, up to two hours paid leave may be authorized at the beginning or end of the work day. An employee must request time off to vote \(in writing\) from his or her supervisor at least 5 working days prior to Election Day. Any employee requesting paid time off for this purpose must show evidence of eligibility to vote, \(a current voter registration card\) when making the request. An employee is not eligible if the Election Day occurs on a non-work day.

### 5.11 Military Leave {#5-11-military-leave}

The City complies with all federal and state laws relating to employees in reserve or active military service, and does not discriminate against employees who serve in the military. The City supports its employees and their service in state and national military units and provides them with a number of military leave benefits.

This policy covers regular employees who serve in reserve or active military service, on a voluntary or involuntary basis. Please note, this policy is generally not applicable to temporary employees who have brief or non-recurrent positions with the City and who have no reasonable expectation that their employment with the City will continue for a significant period of time.

**Notice to City of Need for Leave.** Employees must provide as much advance written and/or verbal notice to the City as possible for all military duty leave \(unless giving notice is impossible, unreasonable, or precluded by military necessity\). Absent unusual circumstances, such notice must be given to the City no later than 24 hours after the employee receives the military orders. To be eligible for paid military leave, employees must complete and submit the necessary documentation, including the official documents setting forth the purpose of the leave and, if known, its duration. This documentation must be turned into your Department Head and the Human Resources Department as far in advance of the leave as possible.

**Paid Leave for Training and Duty.**

1. Full Pay For Up to 15 Days. In accordance with Section 431.005, Texas Government Code, regular full and part-time employees of the City will be paid for military absences of up to 15 workdays per fiscal year \(October 1 through September 30\). For purposes of calculating paid leave time, the City may temporarily transfer 12-hour shift employees to a 40-hour, 7 day work-week schedule. This paid military leave may be used when an employee is engaged in National Guard or U.S. armed forces training or duty ordered or approved by proper military authority. The paid leave days may be taken consecutively or scattered throughout the year.
2. Other Paid Leave. Employees who are not eligible for paid military leave or who have exhausted all available paid military leave may, at their option, use any other available paid leave time, except sick leave \(i.e., vacation leave, holiday leave or comp time\) to cover their absence from work.
3. Unpaid Leave. After an employee has exhausted all available paid military leave \(and any other paid leave time that the employee chooses to use to cover a military absence\), the employee will be placed on leave without pay for up to 5 years.
4. Benefits. The City will continue to provide employees on paid military leave with most City benefits.
5. Medical and Dental. While an employee is on military leave of less than 31 days, the City will continue to pay its portion of the monthly premium for group health benefits. When military leave exceeds 31 days, the employee may elect to continue group health coverage for up to 18 months following separation of employment or until their re-employment rights expire, whichever event occurs first, for himself/herself and eligible dependent

   Upon an employee’s return to employment following military service, the City will provide health insurance coverage immediately, even if a waiting period is normally required for new or returning employees. In addition, a returning employee will not be subjected to exclusions from coverage unless the exclusions apply to injuries or conditions that were incurred as a result of military service.

6. Other Benefits. While on paid military leave, employees continue to accrue vacation, sick leave and other benefits provided to other employees on paid leave. While on unpaid military leave, employees are generally ineligible for most City-provided benefits. Benefit accruals, such as vacation and sick leave, do not accrue while an employee is on unpaid leave, including unpaid military leave. While on unpaid military leave, benefit accruals will be suspended and will resume upon the employee’s return to active employment. Upon return to active employment following military leave, employees will be treated as though they were continuously employed for purposes of determining seniority and benefits based on length of service, such as vacation accrual.

7. TMRS. Typically, an employee’s period of uniformed service is deemed to constitute service for purposes of vesting and benefit accrual. Thus, employees earn service credit for time spent on active duty military leave. Service time is credited when an employee returns to work. To qualify for service credit, an employee must return to work for the City within 90 days after discharge; receive an honorable discharge; and timely complete the necessary application. In order to receive monetary credit, an employee has the lesser of 5 years or 3 times the length of the military service to make up any TMRS contributions that were missed while on military leave.

8. Returning from Leave.  
   1. Re-employment Rights. In most cases, employees who complete their military service will be re-employed in their previous position or a similar position with the City. Federal law requires that employees returning from military leave be rehired in the position they would have had if they had been continuously employed. Since most jobs and promotions in the City are not awarded based on seniority, it is impossible to know what job an employee might have had if he/she had been continuously employed. This means most employees returning from military leave will typically be restored to the job they held at the commencement of their military leave.  
   2. Deadline to Notify City of Intent to Return to Work. The deadline for an employee to return to work and/or notify the City that he/she intends to return to work following military leave depends upon how long the employee’s military service lasted:  
      1. For service of less than 31 days, employees have 8 hours following their return home from service to report for their next scheduled work period.  
      2. For service between 31 days and 180 days, employees have 14 days following their release from service to apply for re-employment.  
      3. For service of more than 180 days, employees have 90 days following their release from service to apply for re-employment.  
      4. These deadlines may be extended for 2 years or more when an employee suffers service-related injuries that prevent him/her from applying for re-employment or when circumstances beyond the employee’s control make reporting within the time limits impossible or unreasonable.  
   3. Required Documentation. To qualify to return to work, an employee returning from leave must provide documentation of the length and character of his/her military service. Also, evidence of discharge or release under honorable conditions must be submitted to the City if the military leave lasted more than 31 calendar days.  
   4. Rights to Continued Employment. Employees who actively serve in the military, and take military leave in excess of 6 months will not be discharged by the City without cause for 1 year following the date of their re-employment. Employees who actively serve for between 1 and 6 months will not be discharged without cause for 6 months following the date of their re-employment.  
   5. Changed Circumstances. If the City’s circumstances have changed to such an extent that it would be impossible or unreasonable to reemploy an employee, the City has no legal obligation to reemploy an employee following his/her return from military leave. \(For example, a reduction-in-force that eliminates the position held by an employee returning from military leave.\) The City is not required to make efforts to qualify returning employees for particular positions or to make accommodations for employees who suffered service-related disabilities when such efforts or accommodations would impose an undue hardship on the City.

### 5.12 Authorized Leave Without Pay {#5-12-authorized-leave-without-pay}

In circumstances not falling within other leave policies, the City Administrator may, upon the recommendation of the appropriate Department Head and in his or her sole discretion, authorize leave without pay. Example of factors considered by the City in granting leave without pay include the reason for the leave, departmental work requirements, and the employee’s work performance and disciplinary history. Such leave will normally be granted up to a maximum period of 30 days. The Employee may seek extensions of leave up to a maximum of 6 months. This policy will be administered consistent with the City’s obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

**Documentation.** Requests for leave without pay must be made in writing to the employee’s Department Head as far in advance as possible prior to the requested leave date. Requests for an extension of leave must also be in writing and submitted to the Department Head. The need for a medical leave of absence must be supported by documentation as required by law and these policies.

Before returning to work from a medical leave of absence, the employee will be required to submit a letter from his or her doctor stating that the employee is able to resume his or her normal job duties, as outlined in the employee’s position description.

**Other Employment During Leave.** Under no circumstances may an employee on an authorized leave without pay work another job, whether for pay, as a volunteer or as self-employment, unless expressly authorized in writing by the Department Head and the City Administrator.

**Anniversary Date.** An employee’s anniversary date may, for purposes of annual performance evaluations and benefit eligibility and accrual, be changed to account for extended absences from work. With the exception of military leave, any leave without pay exceeding 30 calendar days will result in the employee's anniversary date being changed by adding the exact number of days of leave to the employee’s existing anniversary date.

**Reinstatement.** Employees returning from “Authorized Leave Without Pay” will be reinstated to their same position or one of similar pay and status provided the City’s circumstances have not changed to the extent that it would be impossible or unreasonable to provide reinstatement. If the same job or one of similar pay and status is not available, reinstatement may, at the City’s discretion, be deferred until a position is available. An employee who fails to return to work at the conclusion of an approved leave of absence will be considered to have voluntarily resigned his or her employment with the City.

**Payment of Insurance Premiums.** Any insurance premiums, or partial premiums, normally paid on behalf of the employee by the City will not be paid by the City beginning the first day of the month following the starting date of an unpaid leave of absence. \(Note: The City will continue to pay its portion, if any, of group health insurance premiums for any Family and Medical Leave Act qualifying leave\). Employees who have group health or any other kind of insurance through the City continue to be responsible for paying their portion of the premiums while on a leave of absence. An employee’s failure to pay insurance premiums due during a leave of absence may result in cancellation of coverage.

**Benefits.** All leaves of absence are unpaid, and vacation, sick leave, holiday pay and other benefits do not accrue during an unpaid leave of absence.

**TMRS.** Employee contributions to TMRS while an employee is in a leave without pay status may be made on a voluntary basis through a special arrangement with the City. It is the employee’s responsibility to initiate such an arrangement by timely contacting the Human Resources Department and completing the necessary paperwork.

**Revocation.** The City Administrator may revoke “Authorized Leave Without Pay” at any time.

### 5.13 On-the-Job Injury Leave {#5-13-on-the-job-injury-leave}

Most on-the-job injuries are covered by the City’s workers’ compensation insurance. Please see the City’s Workers’ Compensation Benefits Policy. Employees may supplement any workers’ compensation wage benefits with any accrued vacation, holiday, sick or compensatory leave. However, in no event will an employee be paid more than 100% of his or her regular pay.

### 5.14 Family and Medical Leave Act {#5-14-family-and-medical-leave-act}

The City provides leave to eligible employees in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act \(FMLA\). Under the FMLA, eligible employees may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during a twelve month period for specified family and medical reasons. The 12-month period during which an employee is eligible for 12 work weeks of leave will be measured forward from the date of the employee’s first day of FMLA leave.

**FMLA Leave Runs Concurrently with Other Types of Leave.** If an employee has any available accrued sick leave, it must be used concurrently with any available FMLA leave. If the employee has no sick time, or once all accrued sick time has been used, all unused holiday, and vacation leave will be used and will run concurrently with any remaining FMLA leave. If the employee is eligible for short-term or long-term disability, it too must be used concurrently with any available FMLA leave. FMLA leave shall also run concurrently with leave taken by an employee as worker's compensation leave if the illness or injury meets the criteria for a serious health condition.

Employees may also request to use accrued compensatory leave for an FMLA reason. Any leave time paid from the employee's accrued compensatory leave will not be counted against the employee's 12-week FMLA leave entitlement.

**Employee Eligibility.** To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have worked for the City:

\(A\) for at least 12 months, and

\(B\) for at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months preceding the start of the leave.

**Leave Entitlement.** Eligible employees may take FMLA leave for one or more of the following reasons:

\(A\) for the birth of the employee’s child or placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care;

\(B\) to care for a spouse, child, or parent of the employee with a serious health condition;

\(C\) when the employee is unable to perform the functions of his or her position because of his or her own serious health condition.

FMLA leave for birth or placement for adoption or foster care must conclude within 12 months of the birth or placement.

**Notice Requirements.** In order for the City to accommodate an employee's workload during his or her absence, employees seeking to take FMLA leave must provide their Department Head with at least 30 days’ advance notice when the leave is foreseeable. If the leave is not foreseeable, employees are expected to provide their Department Head with as much advance notice as possible. In the event of medical leave for planned medical treatment for the employee or for the employee's spouse, child or parent, the employee is required to make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the City’s operations.

When an employee takes paid or unpaid leave for a reason that qualifies for FMLA leave, the employee shall include in the notice or request given to the Department Head, a description of the reason for the leave. \(Note: Under the FMLA, an employee requesting paid or unpaid leave for an absence covered by the FMLA is not required to expressly mention FMLA. If the employee states a reason that qualifies as FMLA leave, the employee, will likely have met the FMLA’s notice requirements\).

Within two business days of receipt of notice from an employee requesting leave, the Department Head shall determine whether the reason for the leaves qualifies for FMLA leave, and notify the employee and the Human Resources Department in writing of the determination. If the Department Head is not given sufficient information to determine whether the employee qualifies for FMLA leave, within two business days of receiving adequate information, the Department Head will notify the employee that the leave has been designated as FMLA leave and leave taken before the date of notice will be counted against the employee’s twelve-week FMLA leave.

When leave qualifies as FMLA leave, the Human Resources Department shall provide the employee with an FMLA Information Form detailing the specific expectations and obligations of the employee and explaining any consequences of a failure to meet these obligations. The written information will be provided to the employee in a language in which the employee is literate.

All supervisors must immediately notify the Human Resources Coordinator if they have reason to believe that an employee’s absence is due to an FMLA-covered reason.

**Medical Certification and Other Required Documentation.** Employees must provide the City with a medical certification from the employee’s health care provider supporting the need for FMLA leave due to a serious health condition affecting the employee or the employee's spouse, child or parent. The certification must set forth the beginning and expected ending dates of the leave. If the ending date is subject to change, the employee must notify the City of any changes within two business days, if possible. The certification must also contain the appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the condition. In the case of intermittent leave, the certification must also provide the dates and duration of the treatments necessitating the intermittent leave. If an employee elects to take FMLA leave in order to care for a family member, the employee may be required to provide reasonable documentation confirming a family relationship.

If the City has reason to doubt the validity of the medical certification provided, the City may require a second or third medical opinion \(at the City’s expense\) and periodic recertification of the serious health condition. If an employee fails to provide any required certification within 15 days, the City may deny leave until the certification is provided.

During FMLA leave, employees must provide the Human Resources Department with periodic reports as to their status and intent to return to work.

Employees returning from FMLA leave due to their own serious health condition will be required to submit a "fitness-for-duty" certification before returning to work. If an employee fails to provide a requested fitness-for-duty certification to return to work, the City may delay restoration until the employee submits the certificate.

**Delay or Denial of FMLA Benefits.** The City may delay the taking of FMLA leave under the following circumstances:

\(A\) if an employee fails to give timely advance notice when the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable, FMLA leave may be delayed until 30 days after the date the employee provides notice to the City of the need for FMLA leave;

\(B\) if an employee fails to provide in a timely manner a requested medical certification to substantiate the need for FMLA leave, the continuation of FMLA leave may be delayed until the employee submits the certificate.

If the employment relationship terminates, an employee's rights to continued leave, maintenance of health benefits, and restoration cease under FMLA. If an employee fraudulently obtains FMLA leave, the city may deny job restoration and/or maintenance of health benefits.

**Intermittent Leave.** Eligible employees may take FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis only if medically necessary to care for a seriously ill spouse, child or parent; or because of the employee's serious health condition. Intermittent leave may be taken to care for a newborn or newly placed adopted or foster care child only with the approval of the employee’s Department Head and the City Administrator.

Employees needing intermittent/reduced schedule leave for foreseeable medical treatment must work with their supervisor to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the City's operations, subject to the approval of the employee's health care provider. In such cases, the City may temporarily transfer the employee to an available alternative position \(with equivalent pay and benefits\) in order to better accommodate repeated periods of absence.

**Benefits During FMLA Leave.** During any period of FMLA leave, the City will continue to pay its portion, if any, of any group health insurance coverage for the employee on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. Where applicable, the employee must timely pay his or her share of health insurance premiums while on FMLA leave. Upon at least 15 days written notice, the City may discontinue insurance coverage if the employee’s share of health insurance premiums are more than 30 days past due. The City may recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage for an employee who fails to return to work from FMLA leave, unless the employee is unable to return due to a serious health condition or something else beyond the employee's control. Medical certification is required under such circumstances.

The employee’s use of FMLA leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of the employee’s leave; however, benefit accruals, such as vacation and sick leave, will be suspended during any unpaid leave.

**TMRS.** Employee contributions to TMRS may be made on a voluntary basis through a special arrangement with the City while an employee is in a leave without pay status. It is the employee’s responsibility to initiate such an arrangement by timely contacting the City’s Finance Director and completing the necessary paperwork.

**Job Restoration After FMLA Leave.** Upon return from FMLA leave, an employee will be restored to his or her original job or to an equivalent job in terms of pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment. Under certain circumstances, however, the City is not required to reinstate "key" employees. Certain highly compensated key employees may be denied reinstatement when necessary to prevent “substantial and grievous economic injury” to the City’s operations. A “key” employee is a salaried eligible employee who is among the highest paid ten percent of employees within 75 miles of the worksite. Employees will be notified of their status as a key employee, when applicable, after they request FMLA leave.

**Spouses Employed by the City.** If an employee and the employee's spouse are both employed by the City, both are jointly entitled to a combined total of 12 work weeks of family leave for the birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or to care for a parent with a serious or life threatening health condition.

**Other Employment.** Under no circumstances may an employee on FMLA leave work another job, whether for pay, as a volunteer or as self-employment, unless expressly authorized in writing by the Department Head and the City Administrator.

**FLSA Considerations.** Salaried executive, administrative, and professional employees of the City who meet the Fair Labor Standards Act \(FLSA\) criteria for exemption from minimum wage and overtime do not lose their FLSA-exempt status by using any unpaid FMLA leave. This special exception to the “salary basis” requirements for the FLSA’s exemptions extends only to eligible employees’ use of leave required by the FMLA.

**Other Provisions.** The FMLA does not affect any federal or state law prohibiting discrimination or supersede any state or local law which provides greater family or medical leave rights.

This policy is intended to explain benefits available to eligible employees under the FMLA. It is not intended to create any rights to leave beyond those created by the FMLA. If you would like additional information on the FMLA, please contact your supervisor. When an employee gives notice of the need for FMLA leave, the employee will be given additional information as to his or her rights and responsibilities under the FMLA. In addition, employees may contact the nearest office of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage & Hour Division for more information.

### 5.15 Short-Term Unpaid Leave {#5-15-short-term-unpaid-leave}

Exempt employees may take a partial day of unpaid leave only under the following circumstances:

\(A\) Unpaid leave may be taken pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act.

\(B\) Pursuant to principles of public accountability, an absence of less than one work-day may be taken for personal reasons or because of illness or injury when accrued leave is not used because permission for its use has not been sought or has been sought and denied; accrued leave has been exhausted; or the employee chooses to use leave without pay.

In all other situations, exempt employees who wish to take unpaid leave for personal reasons may not take a partial day of unpaid leave; unpaid leave may only be taken in full-day increments.

No deductions will be made from an exempt employee’s salary for absences, whether for a full or partial day, if the absence is caused by the City or by the operating requirements of the City, e.g., if City Hall is closed due to bad weather, if City Hall is closed for an official City holiday, or if there is no work to be performed. Further, exempt employees will be paid for absences caused by jury duty, or attendance as a witness in a legal proceeding where the employee is not a party \(unless it is job related\). The City may, however, offset an exempt employee’s salary by the amount the employee receives in jury or witness fees.

This policy is subject to the general rule that, absent accrued paid leave time, an employee need not be paid for any work week in which he or she performs no work.

### 5.16 On-the-Job Injuries/Worker’s Compensation Benefits {#5-16-on-the-job-injuries-worker-s-compensation-benefits}

**Coverage.** The City provides workers’ compensation coverage for all employees through the Texas Municipal League. The Fund provides for medical expenses and partial compensation to employees injured on the job. The cost of such coverage is paid by the City and covers most injuries sustained on the job. Neither the City nor its workers’ compensation insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of workers’ compensation benefits for injuries that occur during an employee’s voluntary participation in any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by the City. Such injuries, however, may be covered under your personal medical insurance plan.

**Report of Accidents and Injuries.** All employees must comply with any initial reporting requirements established by the City. Supervisors, in turn, must complete the TWCC-1 form and have it delivered to the Human Resources Coordinator within 24 hours of the time and date of the incident. Thereafter, an employee on worker’s compensation leave must report to the City on a weekly basis, or as otherwise directed by their Department Head. An employee must immediately notify the City when released to return to work.

**Filing Claims.** All workers’ compensation claims must be filed with the Human Resources Department through appropriate supervisory channels.

**Salary Continuation Benefits.** Temporary, part-time, and seasonal employees, as well as full-time employees who have not completed their initial probationary employment period or are on a disciplinary probation, are ineligible for salary continuation benefits.

When a regular, full-time employee incurs an on-the-job injury or illness that is covered by the City’s workers’ compensation carrier and requires the employee to take workers’ compensation leave, the employee is eligible for salary continuation benefits. To receive salary continuation benefits, the injured employee is required to exchange his/her workers’ compensation benefit payments for the employee’s regular pay checks. Salary continuation benefits may be paid for up to six months.

Under no circumstances will an employee on workers’ compensation leave receive paid benefits \(e.g., workers’ compensation, salary benefits, salary continuation benefits, disability insurance benefits, or paid leave time\) in excess of the amount the employee would normally receive in base salary/wages \(excluding overtime, shift differential, or any other type of extra compensation\) if the employee was not injured and able to return to work.

**Modified Duty.** Every effort will be made to return injured employees to the workplace as soon as they are medically released. The Human Resources Department will coordinate the employee’s return to work with that employee’s Department Head. Modified duty will be offered if a work assignment exists within the City which meets the abilities documented by the employee’s attending physician or the city physician; and a modified duty work assignment would enhance the recovery of an injured or ill employee and facilitate the employee's return to the regular duty work assignment held before the injury or illness. A modified duty work assignment may last until the time that the attending physician or city physician has set as the expected date of return to the employee's previous work assignment, but not to exceed three months unless the City Administrator gives written approval for a longer period. As a condition of continuing in a modified duty work assignment, an employee must adhere to prescribed treatment and make reasonable efforts toward rehabilitation; accept progressively more demanding assignments as the employee's condition improves; and make visible progress in returning to full performance capability.

An employee's modified duty work assignment will be terminated immediately if:

\(A\) the employee is found performing beyond the modified duty restrictions;

\(B\) the work assignment is completed;

\(C\) the employee performs unsatisfactorily in the position; or

\(D\) budgetary constraints do not allow continuation of the position.

An employee who does not agree or accept a bona fide offer of employment, including a modified duty work assignment that has been approved by his/her physician may be subject to disciplinary action \(e.g., termination\) and/or a reduction in income benefits, as allowed by the Texas Workers’ Compensation Act.

**Use of Accrued Leave to Supplement Compensation Benefits.** Employees who do not qualify for salary continuation benefits or who do not wish to be bound by the restrictions imposed for salary continuation benefits, may use any available paid leave time to supplement their worker’s compensation salary benefits.

**TMRS.** Employee contributions to TMRS made on the basis of temporary income benefits received through workers’ compensation may be made on a voluntary basis through a special arrangement with the City. It is the employee’s responsibility to initiate such an arrangement by timely contacting the City’s Human Resources Department and completing the necessary paperwork.

### 5.17 Group Insurance Benefits {#5-17-group-insurance-benefits}

**Life Insurance.** The City presently provides life insurance coverage for all regular full-time employees at no cost to the employee. Part-time and temporary employees are not eligible for participation. Eligibility for life insurance coverage usually begins after a brief waiting period required by the insurance carrier. Employee dependents may also be eligible for participation under the City’s life insurance plan. Dependant life insurance must be paid for by the employee through a payroll deduction.

**Health, Dental and Accident Insurance.** Regular full-time employees are presently provided group health and at no cost to the employee. Part-time and temporary employees are not eligible for participation. Coverage generally begins immediately upon employment or after a short probationary period \(if required by the insurance carrier\). Employees may elect to cover their current spouse and/or dependent children under the City’s health and dental plans, provided the premiums are paid for by the employee through a payroll deduction.

**Group Life and Accident Insurance.** Eligible employees may elect to purchase life, accident, and cancer insurance for themselves or their dependents from a company, which has made arrangements with the City, through payroll deduction. Additional information may be obtained in the Human Resources Department. Eligibility begins after 30 days of employment.

**Additional Information.** This is only a general description of available group insurance coverage. For additional information regarding the City’s group insurance policies, you may review the appropriate Summary Plan Description and/or contact the Human Resources Department.

### 5.18 Unemployment Insurance Benefits {#5-18-unemployment-insurance-benefits}

The program provides weekly benefits if you become unemployed through no fault of your own or due to circumstances described in the law.

### 5.19 Texas Municipal Retirement System {#5-19-texas-municipal-retirement-system}

The City participates in the Texas Municipal Retirement System \(TMRS\) to provide retirement benefits for employees. Full-time employees are eligible for participation immediately upon employment. Regular part-time employees who work at least 1,000 hours or more per year are also eligible for participation immediately upon employment. Temporary employees are not eligible for participation in TMRS.

Employees who terminate employment or retire from the City prior to establishing the mandatory number of contributing years to TMRS may be refunded their contributions to date, plus any accrued interest subject to TMRS’ policies and regulations. If an employee transfers to another city with TMRS benefits, he or she is eligible to have his or her contribution transferred to that city subject to TMRS’ policies and regulations.

The above information is a summary only. Additional information is provided in the TMRS handbook, available in the Human Resources Department.

Appropriate forms must be filed with TMRS before contributions can be refunded. Employees terminating employment after the mandatory contribution time have the choice of remaining in TMRS or receiving a refund of their contributions to date, subject to TMRS’ regulations.

### 5.20 Deferred Compensation 457 Plan {#5-20-deferred-compensation-457-plan}

Regular full-time employees have the option to contribute to the International City Administrators Association Retirement Corporation 457 retirement plan through payroll deduction. Additional information on this benefit may be obtained from the Human Resources Coordinator. Eligibility begins after 30 days of employment.

### 5.21 Social Security {#5-21-social-security}

The City of Hudson Oaks does not participate in Social Security, and does not withhold Social Security wages.

### 5.22 Light Duty {#5-22-light-duty}

Light duty assignments for employees with a disability, illness or medical condition which makes them unable to perform their regular job duties are made at the sole discretion of the City, for up to a maximum of three months. The City may terminate a light duty assignment at any time in its accordance with the City’s operational needs. While a genuine effort will be made to locate light duty assignments for employees when temporary medical restrictions preclude their return to their regular duties, the City will not create light duty assignments.

Light duty assignments must be coordinated through the employee’s Department Head. Light duty assignments may be in the employee’s own department, or in another department, depending upon the employee’s circumstances and needs of the City. Employees with an on-the-job injury or illness will be given priority over other employees in the assignment of light duty jobs. The duration of light duty should be the lesser of the duration of the medical restriction or three months. At the end of three months, the case shall be reviewed for determination of status.

Twelve-hour personnel may be reassigned to 40-hour weeks by the Department Head.

Employees on FMLA leave may have the option, but will not be required, to perform a light duty assignment. If the employee refuses a light duty assignment, it will not affect the employee’s entitlement to FMLA leave, but may render the employee ineligible for workers’ compensation salary continuation benefits.

The employee's physician must review and certify that the employee can perform the light duty assignment. The City reserves the right to require an employee to be medically released \(i.e., able to perform his/her essential job functions with or without a reasonable accommodation\) before returning to full and regular duty.

### 5.23 Free Checking at City Depository {#5-23-free-checking-at-city-depository}

Employees and family members are eligible to receive free checking accounts at the City’s bank depository. Additional information may be obtained from the Human Resources Coordinator. Eligibility begins 30 days from the first day of employment.

### 5.24 Cafeteria Plan {#5-24-cafeteria-plan}

Under section 125 of the IRS Code, employees may pay for dependent health, accident, and dental insurance deductions on a pre-taxed basis in accordance with Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code. This election is made annually. Eligibility begins 30 days from the first day of employment.
