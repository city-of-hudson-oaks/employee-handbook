## 8. Employee Conduct & Work Rules {#employee-conduct-work-rules}

### 8.1 Disciplinary Action {#8-1-disciplinary-action}

To ensure orderly and productive operations and provide the best possible work environment, the City requires employees to follow rules of conduct that will protect the interests of the City and the safety of all employees and citizens.

The City and its employees must, at all time, comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The City will not condone the activities of employees who achieve results through violation of the law or unethical business dealings. This includes any payments for illegal acts, indirect contributions, rebates, and bribery. The City does not permit any activity that fails to stand the closest possible public scrutiny.

All business conduct should be above the minimum standards required by law. Accordingly, employees must ensure than their actions cannot be interpreted as being, in any way, in violation of the laws and regulations governing the operations of the City. Employees uncertain about the application or interpretation of any legal requirements should refer the matter to their supervisor, who, if necessary, should seek the advice of the City Administrator.

**Employee Discipline.** The decision to issue employee discipline will be made after consideration of a variety of factors including, but not limited to the severity of the misconduct, the employee’s past work performance and prior disciplinary history, the employee’s length of service, and any mitigating circumstances. Depending on the circumstances of each individual case, disciplinary action may consist of one or more of the following:

\(A\) counseling session;

\(B\) documented verbal reprimand

\(C\) written reprimand;

\(D\) suspension without pay;

\(E\) reduction in rate of pay;

\(F\) demotion;

\(G\) discharge.

**Disciplinary Probation.** Employees who are suspended or demoted, or whose pay rate is reduced, will automatically be placed on disciplinary probation for up to six months. During the probationary period, employees have no right of appeal. Further, during any disciplinary probation period, the employee is not eligible for any merit pay increases.

**Decision-Making Leave.** Decision-making leave with pay may be appropriate in some situations. It may be used alone, as an alternative to other types of discipline, or in combination with other forms of discipline. The purpose of decision-making leave with pay is to give employees time to decide if they wish to remain employed by the City, and if so, whether they can and will correct their behavior. An employee may only be given decision-making leave with pay once and the leave cannot exceed one day or one shift, as appropriate.

**Pre-disciplinary Meeting.** When proposed disciplinary action includes suspension of one day or one shift \(or more\), a reduction of an employee’s rate of pay, demotion, or termination, the employee will be given an opportunity to respond to the allegations prior to disciplinary action being taken. The employee’s supervisor will meet with the employee, inform the employee in writing of the specific rule\(s\) violated; the specific acts of the employee which were in violation of the rule; and that discipline could be imposed, and give the employee at least 24 hours to respond to the charges, either orally or in writing.

**Review by Department Head.** Any proposed disciplinary action in excess of a verbal reprimand must be reviewed by the employee’s Department Head prior to being given to the employee. This applies to both probationary and non-probationary employees.

**Prohibited Activities.** The City expects its employees to conduct themselves in a businesslike manner. Disciplinary action will be imposed for violations of City or Departmental policies and procedures, codes of conduct, rules and regulations, either written or verbal. Disciplinary action may also be imposed for acts which are not specifically addressed in policies and procedures, codes of conduct, and rules and regulations, but which may adversely affect the City or put the health and safety of fellow employees or citizens at risk.

**Felonies and Misdemeanors.** Employees must immediately notify their supervisor and/or their Department Head if they are arrested, charged, indicted, convicted, receive deferred adjudication, or plead nolo contendere to any misdemeanor or felony; provided, however, employees who do not drive as part of their job duties with the City are not required to report minor traffic violations.

When an employee is arrested, charged or indicted for a felony or misdemeanor, or accused of official misconduct or other serious criminal violation, and the evidence obtained during an internal administrative investigation supports a violation of this section, disciplinary action may be taken independently of and before any legal action or criminal conviction.

**Administrative Leave.** During an internal investigation into alleged misconduct or violations of City policies, the City may, at its sole discretion, place the employee on paid administrative leave.

At the City Administrator’s discretion, an employee arrested, charged or indicted for a felony or misdemeanor, or accused of official misconduct or other serious criminal violation, may be placed on unpaid administrative leave until the charge, indictment or information is dismissed or fully adjudicated without trial, and, if tried, until the trial and appeal \(if any\) are completed and all related administrative matters are concluded. An employee on administrative leave may be reinstated to the position held before being placed on administrative leave \(if available\) if the indictment or information is dismissed, the employee is acquitted, or the conviction is reversed on appeal.

### 8.2 Personal Appearance {#8-2-personal-appearance}

**General Guidelines.** Dress, grooming, and personal cleanliness are vital to the City’s image as well as the morale of its employees. All employees are expected to present a clean and neat appearance and to dress in a professional manner while on City premises and/or while conducting City business. Reporting to work in a clean and professional manner helps the City to present a positive and professional public image. Employees are expected to dress appropriately for their job and the nature of the work performed.

Friday shall be a standing casual day, provided that attire remains appropriate for a professional business environment.

The City Administrator may declare additional casual days at any time.

**Employees Working at City Hall, Having Routine Contact with the Public and/or Other Third Party Contact.** Employees who work at City Hall, as well as other City employees who routinely have citizen and other third party contact, must also abide by the following:

\(A\) No visible tattoos. Employees who have tattoos must keep them covered with a shirt, pants, skirt, socks, hosiery, or other clothing.

\(B\) No facial or mouth jewelry shall be worn. Women are permitted to wear a single or double earring in each earlobe provided the earring is not otherwise unprofessional in appearance. Men may not wear earrings.

\(C\) Beards and mustaches must be kept clean and neatly trimmed and/or within department guidelines.

\(D\) Hairstyles and hair colors must be appropriate to the employee’s position.

**Enforcement.** In all cases, the City will make the determination as to what is acceptable dress and grooming. Normally, the Department Head will determine appropriateness; however, the City Administrator has final determination. If you have any questions about the dress code, please ask your supervisor or Department Head.

Anyone who is not appropriately groomed or who dresses in violation of the policy will be sent home. Under such circumstances, nonexempt employees will not be paid for work time missed, and exempt employees will be required to make up the work time missed. Employees whose grooming and/or personal appearance violates this policy may be disciplined, up to and including termination of employment.

### 8.3 Uniforms {#8-3-uniforms}

The City supplies those employees required to wear uniforms with appropriate uniforms. If your job requires that you wear a uniform, you will be told how and where they can be obtained. Appropriate shoes and hats may also be required - in some cases they will be furnished to the employee by the City. Replacement uniforms will be provided by the City as necessary. Uniforms must be clean, neat, and in good repair when worn.

City-owned or authorized uniforms may not be used by City employees outside of work, for personal use, or by any third party. City uniforms may be used by City employees in connection with their outside employment only if their Department Head and/or the City Administrator have given prior written authorization.

Uniforms for public safety employees will be provided and employees must abide by these policies, as well as their department’s policies regulating uniforms.

### 8.4 Unauthorized or Improper Use of Official Uniform, Badge, or Authority {#8-4-unauthorized-or-improper-use-of-official-uniform-badge-or-authority}

Employees whose duties involve the use of a badge, identification card, uniform, or insignia as evidence of authority or for identification purposes may not permit such badge, identification card, uniform, or insignia to be used or worn by another person who is not authorized to use or wear same, nor permit same to be out of his of her possession. Badges, identification cards, uniforms and insignia may only be used in the performance of the official duties of the position to which they relate. Badges, identification cards, must be worn at all times and be visible to citizens and co-workers, unless such display would interfere or jeopardize an official cover or undercover investigation.

### 8.5 Housekeeping Duties {#8-5-housekeeping-duties}

Each employee is responsible for maintaining a neat, sanitary, and orderly work area, including, if applicable, office spaces, vehicles, and equipment.

### 8.6 Safety {#8-6-safety}

The City strives to conduct its operations with the utmost regard for the health and safety of its employees and citizens. Each and every employee is required at all times to obey safety rules, to follow appropriate safety procedures, and to exercise caution and good judgment in all work activities. Some employees may be required to wear protective clothes and/or use certain equipment in order to safely carry out their duties. Employees who violate safety standards, who cause or exacerbate hazardous or dangerous situations, or who fail to report or, where appropriate, correct such situations, will be subject to immediate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

**Reporting Requirements.** Employees must immediately report any unsafe condition, equipment or practices to the appropriate supervisor and/or Department Head. In addition, all accidents and injuries, however slight or seemingly inconsequential, must immediately be reported to the appropriate supervisor and/or the Department Head. If needed, first aid or medical treatment should be requested. An employee report of accident form must be completed by each employee involved in an accident or injury and turned into the employee’s supervisor. Such reports are necessary so that the City can remain in compliance with applicable laws and begin workers’ compensation benefit procedures where appropriate. Failure to complete and turn in the employee report of accident form and/or failure to report any accident or injury within twenty-four hours of its occurrence will likely result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

**Departmental Rules.** Certain Departments will have safety rules specific to the duties performed and equipment used. These policies may include training requirements \(including initial training for new employees as well as on-going training for other employees\), use of protective equipment and clothing, and other appropriate topics. Employees with questions regarding safety should talk to their supervisor.

### 8.7 Searches {#8-7-searches}

The City may, at any time, conduct unannounced searches or inspections of the worksite, including, but not limited to, City property used by employees such as lockers, file cabinets, desks, vehicles, and offices, whether secured, unsecured or secured by a lock provided by the employee. If reasonable suspicion exists, the City may also conduct unannounced searches or inspection of the employee’s personal property located on City premises, including purses, lunch boxes, briefcases, and private vehicles or vehicles used to conduct City business located on City property. Employees are not entitled to any expectation of privacy with respect to such items.

All searches must be authorized in advance by the City Administrator and conducted under the direction of the Department Head and/or City Administrator. Employees who refuse to cooperate with a search will likely be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

### 8.8 Smoking and Tobacco Products {#8-8-smoking-and-tobacco-products}

In keeping with the City’s desire to provide a safe and healthful work environment, smoking \(and the use of other tobacco products\) is prohibited throughout the workplace, including City vehicles. Smoking is only permitted outside, in areas specifically designated for smoking. Smoking is not permitted during an employee’s work time -- it is only permitted during meal breaks, designated rest periods, before and after regular business hours. When conducting City business in the offices or other premises of a third party, employees must follow their smoking policies.

This policy applies equally to all employees, citizens, and other visitors. Employees who violate this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### 8.9 Use of City Equipment {#8-9-use-of-city-equipment}

From time to time, the City may issue equipment or other property to employees, e.g., purchasing cards \(credit cards\), keys, tools, security passes, manuals, written materials, telephone cards, uniforms, mobile telephones, 2-way radios, computers, and computer-related equipment. Employees are responsible for items formally issued to them by the City, as well as for items otherwise in their possession or control or used by them in the performance of their duties. At the time of issuance, employees may be required to sign certain forms or other documentation evidencing their receipt of property and/or equipment and authorizing a payroll deduction for the cost of lost, damaged or unreturned items. In addition to payroll deductions, the City may take any other action it deems appropriate or necessary to recover and/or protect its property.

Equipment essential in accomplishing job duties is often expensive and may be difficult to replace. When using equipment owned or leased by the City, employees are expected to exercise care, perform required maintenance, and follow all operating instructions, safety standards, and guidelines. The City’s equipment and other property may not be removed from the premises or used for personal business. Under no circumstances may City property be loaned or rented.

You must notify your supervisor immediately if any equipment, machines, or tools appear to be damaged or defective, or are in need of repair. Your supervisor can answer any questions about your responsibility for maintenance and care of equipment used on the job. The improper, careless, negligent, destructive, or unsafe use or operation of equipment will likely result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

**City Owned Computers Used Primarily At Home.** City-owned computers may be issued to certain employees for use at their home or other locations for City business, subject to advance written approval by the City Administrator. Employees who are issued a City computer primary for home use agree to the following:

\(A\) An itemized list describing in detail all City hardware must be made and signed by both the employee and the City Administrator before an employee may take a City computer home;

\(B\) Prior to being issued a City computer and related items for home use, the employee must acknowledge, in writing, that this policy has been read, understood, and will be followed;

### 8.10 Use of City Vehicles {#8-10-use-of-city-vehicles}

City-owned or leased vehicles may only be used for official City business. City owned or leased vehicles may only be driven by authorized City employees. If an employee drives his or her own vehicle to conduct City-related business, or a City-owned, rented or leased vehicle, the employee must comply with the following:

\(A\) Employee must have a valid State of Texas driver’s license appropriate for the vehicle operated and must inform his or her supervisor of any change in status.

\(B\) Employee must always observe all posted laws and speed limits.

ANY ACCIDENT REPORTS, ALONG WITH ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT REPORT, MUST BE FILED BY THE EMPLOYEE WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEAD THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT \(Accident Report Forms can be obtained from the Human Resources Coordinator\). AFTER FILLING OUT THE ACCIDENT REPORT, EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN ACCIDENT WHILE OPERATING A CITY VEHICLE MUST TAKE A DRUG SCREEN IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING \(The Drug Screen will be set up by the Human Resources Coordinator\).

\(F\) Drivers covered by Department of Transportation regulations must comply with them at all times.

**Accident Review Board**

1. An Accident Review Board will be established to review all vehicle accidents and damage. The chairman will be appointed by the Chief of Police or his designee and will serve a one year period. The Board will be comprised of the following personnel:
   1. One supervisor – chairman \(No Vote\)
   2. One patrol officer
   3. One city employee from administration
   4. One city employee from public works
   5. One outside law enforcement Agency Officer
2. At the discretion of the City Administrator the Accident Review Board may review and recommend action on other accidents involving the City of Hudson Oaks vehicles.

The City may, at any time, check the driving record of a City employee who drives as part of his/her job duties to determine that he/she maintains the necessary qualifications as a City driver. Employees agree that they will cooperate by providing the City any authorization that may be required for this purpose.

The above is not a complete and exhaustive list of vehicle use policies. Violations of any of the specific items listed, as well as the improper, careless, negligent, destructive, or unsafe use or operation of a vehicle, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### 8.11 Security and Loss Prevention {#8-11-security-and-loss-prevention}

It is everyone’s responsibility to help the City in loss prevention. If an employee becomes aware of losses or damage due to negligence, theft, willful destruction or abuse, or for any other reason, it is the employee’s responsibility to report it to a supervisor, a Department Head and/or the City Administrator’s office immediately. Employees must notify management immediately of any incident that results in loss or damage to the City, its employees, or the general public. Employees should also promptly notify management of any situation which may result in such a loss. Investigation of theft or other criminal behavior may require that employees cooperate with law enforcement officials. Failure to report loss or damage, or failure to cooperate in an investigation may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

Employees who have access to the City’s funds in any form must follow the prescribed procedures for recording, handling, and protecting money as detailed in this policy, and departmental procedures and guidelines. The City imposes strict standards to prevent fraud and dishonestly. If employees become aware of any evidence of fraud or dishonestly, they must immediately advise their supervisor so that the City can promptly investigate.

Accurate and reliable records are necessary to meet the City’s legal and financial obligations and to manage the affairs of the City. The City’s books and records must reflect, in an accurate and timely manner, all business transactions. The employees responsible for accounting and record-keeping must fully disclose and record all assets and liabilities, and must exercise due diligence in enforcing these requirements.

Employees must not make or engage in any false record or communication of any kind, whether internal or external, including, but not limited to:

\(A\) False expenses, attendance, production, financial, or other similar reports or statement.

\(B\) False advertising, deceptive marketing practices, or other misleading representations.

Supervisors, or their designees, are responsible for locking and securing all doors, gates, chains, locks, setting alarms, etc., and for key removal from vehicles and equipment. Other security measures may also be required from time to time. Failing to comply with security precautions is a serious violation of City policy.

Any employee who becomes aware of or witnesses an incident of a nature described above – and who fails to report it in a timely manner – may be considered a party to any loss that occurs. In such cases, disciplinary action may be taken against the primary offender and the employee who failed to report it or concealed knowledge of the incident.

Absent specific approval from the City Administrator, only authorized City employees are permitted on City premises outside of regular business hours. Only authorized City employees are permitted in secured areas of the premises. A violation of this policy, or a failure to report a violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### 8.12 Weapons Ban and Violence Prevention Policy {#8-12-weapons-ban-and-violence-prevention-policy}

**Zero Tolerance.** The City is concerned about providing its employees with a safe and productive work environment and thus has taken certain steps to help prevent incidents of violence from occurring in the workplace. Harassment, intimidation, threats, threatening behavior, violent behavior or acts of violence between employees or such action between an employee and a citizen arising from or is in any manner connected to the employee’s employment with the City, whether the conduct occurs on duty or off duty, will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy will lead to disciplinary action which may include discipline up to and including termination, as well as arrest and criminal prosecution.

Any person who makes a threat of use of force, violence or threatens an unlawful act, exhibits threatening behavior, or engages in violent acts on City property will be removed from the premises pending the outcome of an investigation. The City will initiate an appropriate response which may include, but is not limited to, suspension and/or termination of the employment relationship, reassignment of job duties, mandatory counseling with a psychologist or other mental health care provider of the City’s choosing, and/or criminal prosecution of the person or persons involved.

**All Weapons Banned.** No employee, other than a licensed peace officer of the City, may carry or possess a firearm or other weapon on City property, including, without limitation, buildings, entrances, exits, break areas, parking lots, surrounding areas and parks. The City’s policy flatly prohibits employees, other than licensed peace officers, from carrying or using any weapons, concealed or otherwise, on the City’s premises. This ban includes keeping or transporting a weapon in any City-owned or leased vehicle or in a personal vehicle in a City-provided parking area. Employees are also prohibited from carrying a weapon while on duty or at any time while engaging in City-related business. Prohibited weapons include firearms, clubs, explosive devices, knives with blades exceeding 5 ½ inches, switchblades, etc., as defined by Texas Penal Code Section 46.01.

No existing City policy, practice, or procedure will be interpreted to conflict with decisions designed to prevent a threat from being carried out, a violent act from occurring or a life-threatening situation from developing.

**Mandatory Reporting.** An employee who witnesses, or has knowledge of intimidation, threats, threatening behavior, violent behavior or acts of violence involving a City employee must immediately notify his/her supervisor, Department Head and/or the City Administrator’s office. Employees must also report any behavior they have witnessed which may be regarded as threatening or violent, when that behavior is job related or might be carried out on a City controlled site or City job site, or when that behavior is in any manner connected to City employment or activities. Each employee is responsible for making this report regardless of the relationship between the individual who initiated the threat or threatening behavior and the person or persons threatened or the focus of the threatening behavior.

All individuals who apply for or obtain a protective or restraining order which lists City property as a protected area, must notify their Department Head and provide a copy of the petition and declarations used to seek the order, a copy of any temporary protective or restraining order which is granted, and a copy of any protective or restraining order which is made permanent to the City Administrator’s office. Likewise, all employees must immediately advise their Department Head or the City Administrator’s Office if any protective or restraining order is issued against them.

To the extent possible, while accomplishing the purposes of this policy, the City will respect the privacy of reporting employees and will treat information and reports confidentially.

### 8.13 Conflict of Interest {#8-13-conflict-of-interest}

The City and its employees must, at all time, comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The City will not condone the activities of employees who achieve results through violation of the law or unethical business dealings. This includes any payments for illegal acts, indirect contributions, rebates, and bribery. The City does not permit any activity that fails to stand the closest possible public scrutiny.

All business conduct should be well above the minimum standards required by law. Accordingly, employees must ensure that their actions cannot be interpreted as being, in any way, in contravention of the laws and regulations governing the operations of the City. Employees who are uncertain about the application or interpretation of any legal requirements should refer the matter to their supervisor, who, if necessary, should seek the advice of the City Administrator or the City Attorney’s office.

The City expects that employees will perform their duties conscientiously, honestly, and in accordance with the best interests of the City of Hudson Oaks. Employees must not use their position or the knowledge gained as a result of their position for private or personal advantage. Regardless of the circumstances, if an employee knows or have reason to suspect that a course of action he or she has pursued, is presently pursuing, or is contemplating pursuing may involve the employee in a conflict of interest with the City, the employee must immediately communicate all the facts to his or her supervisor.

All employees share a serious responsibility for the City’s good public relations, especially at the community level. Their readiness to help with religious, charitable, educational, and civic activities brings credit to the City and is encouraged. Employees must, however, avoid acquiring any business interest or participating in any activity that would, or would appear to:

\(A\) Create an excessive demand on their time to the extent that it deprives the City of the employee’s best efforts on the job.

\(B\) Create an obligation, interest, or distraction that may interfere with the independent exercise of judgment in the City’s best interest.

An employee of the City shall not:

\(A\) Invest in or acquire a personal financial interest in any business that has a contractual relationship with the City, or that provides goods or services to the City, if such interest could influence or create the impression of influencing an employee’s decisions in the performance of duties on behalf of the City.

\(B\) Accept entertainment, gifts, or personal favors that could, in any way, influence or create the impression of influencing the employee’s decisions in the performance of duties on behalf of the City.

\(C\) Receive payment or compensation of any kind, except authorized under the City’s policies. In particular, the City strictly prohibits the acceptance of kickbacks or commissions from suppliers or others. Any breach of this rule will result in termination and prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.

\(D\) Use a municipal title, position, or uniform in any advertisement or endorsement of products.

### 8.14 Political Activities {#8-14-political-activities}

City employees will not be appointed or retained on the basis of their political support or activities. City employees are encouraged to vote and to exercise other prerogatives of citizenship consistent with state and federal law and these policies. A City employee may not:

\(A\) Publicly endorse or campaign in any manner for any person seeking a City of Hudson Oaks public office.

\(B\) Use his/her position or office to coerce political support from employees or citizens.

\(C\) Use his/her official authority or influence to interfere with or affect the result of a campaign issue, an election or a nomination for public office.

\(D\) Make, solicit, or receive any contribution to the campaign funds of any candidate for City Council, directly or indirectly through an organization or association; or take any part in the management, affairs or political campaign of any such candidate; provided nothing herein shall infringe the constitutional rights of such office or employee to express his or her opinions and to cast his or her vote.

\(E\) Use working hours or City property to be in any way associated with soliciting or receiving any subscription, contribution or political service or to circulate petitions or campaign literature on behalf of an election issue or candidates for public office in any jurisdiction.

\(F\) Contribute money, labor, time or other valuable thing to any person for City election purposes.

\(G\) Hold an appointive or elective office of public trust where service would constitute a direct conflict of interest with City employment, \(e.g. City Council\). Upon becoming a candidate for such an office, an employee must immediately resign or be dismissed upon failure to do so. If the employee loses the election, he or she may seek reinstatement if the employee’s former position is still open and available.

Notwithstanding any provision in this policy, a sworn employee of the police or fire department may engage in political activities to the extent permitted by state law.

### 8.15 Illegal Discrimination and Harrassment Policy {#8-15-illegal-discrimination-and-harrassment-policy}

Pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the City prohibits all forms of discrimination, including harassment, on the basis of race, color, ancestry, religion, national origin, age, sex, marital status, disability, or veteran status. In keeping with this commitment, the city will not tolerate discrimination or harassment.

The Personnel Officer is responsible for enforcing this policy and will serve as the investigative officer for harassment, discrimination and retaliation issues. The Personnel Officer will receive training about harassment, discrimination and this policy, and will be responsible for investigating complaints.

The Personnel Officer will distribute this policy to all employees. Employees are expected to read this policy and adhere to its provisions at all times.

The City shall provide mandatory training in discrimination and harassment matters for Department Heads and supervisors.

Definitions of Harassment. Harassment constitutes discrimination and is illegal under federal and state law.

For the purpose of this policy, sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:

\(A\) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment;

\(B\) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or

\(C\) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.

Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not so subtle behaviors and may involve individuals of the same or different gender. Depending on the circumstances, these behaviors may include, but are not limited to: unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual jokes and innuendo; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; commentary about an individual’s body, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies; leering, whistling or touching; insulting or obscene comments or gestures; display in the workplace or sexually suggestive objects or pictures; and other physical, verbal or visual conduct of a sexual nature.

Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. Under this policy, harassment is verbal or physical conduct that singles out, denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, marital status, veteran status, citizenship or any other characteristic protected by law or that of his/her relatives, friends or associates, and that:

\(A\) has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment;

\(B\) has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance; or

\(C\) otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment opportunities.

Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; and written or graphic material that singles out, denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group and that is placed on walls or elsewhere on the employer’s premises or circulated in the workplace.

**Individuals and Conduct Covered.** This policy applies to all applicants and employees, whether related to conduct engaged in by fellow employees or someone not directly connected to the City. Conduct prohibited by these policies is unacceptable in the workplace and in any work-related setting outside the workplace, such as during business trips, business meetings and business-related social events. This policy also applies to citizens, vendors, and visitors to the workplace. Likewise, employees are also prohibited from harassing citizens, vendors, and other third parties.

**Mandatory Reporting of Harassment, Discrimination or Retaliation.** The City requires reporting of all perceived incidents of discrimination, harassment or retaliation, regardless of the offender’s identity or position. An employee who believes that he/she has been a victim of such conduct must immediately report their concerns to a supervisor, Department Head, the City Secretary, the Assistant to the City Administrator, or the City Administrator, whomever the employee feels most comfortable approaching. Any employee who observes or becomes aware of possible sexual or other unlawful harassment, discrimination or retaliation must immediately report it to a Department Head, the City Secretary, the Assistant to the City Administrator, or the City Administrator.

The report may be either oral or written. However, oral reports of harassment, discrimination or retaliation must be reduced to writing by either the complainant or the person who receives the report, and must be signed by the employee.

Anonymous reports will be taken seriously and investigated.

Supervisors and Department Heads must promptly report all harassment, discrimination and retaliation complaints to the Human Resources Director.

In addition, the City encourages employees who encounter harassment to firmly and promptly notify the offender in a professional manner that the behavior is unwelcome and that the conduct must stop.

**Investigation.** Allegations of harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be investigated promptly. Within a reasonable time, the Personnel Officer will produce a written report and provide a copy of the report to the complainant, upon request. The investigation will include individual interviews with the parties involved and, where necessary, with individuals who may have other relevant knowledge. All employees are required to cooperate with the investigation. The Personnel Officer will recommend remedial measures based upon the results of the investigation, and the City Administrator or City Council, as appropriate, will promptly consider and act upon the recommendation. To the extent practicable and allowed by the Texas Public Information Act, the City will keep complaints and the terms of their resolution confidential.

**Retaliation.** Retaliation against an individual for reporting a good faith charge of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation, or for participating in an investigation of a claim of harassment or discrimination is a serious violation of this policy and, like harassment or discrimination itself, will result in serious disciplinary action. Acts of retaliation must be reported immediately and will be promptly investigated and addressed.

**Responsive Action.** Misconduct constituting harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be dealt with appropriately. Responsive action may include, for example, training, referral to counseling and/or disciplinary action such as warning, reprimand, withholding of a promotion or pay increase, reassignment, temporary suspension without pay, or termination.

False complaints, exaggerated and malicious complaints of harassment, discrimination or retaliation as opposed to complaints, which even if erroneous, are made in good faith, will result in appropriate disciplinary action.

**Conclusion.** The City has developed this policy to ensure that all its employees can work in an environment free from harassment, discrimination and retaliation. The City will make every reasonable effort to ensure that all concerned are familiar with these policies and aware that any complaint in violation of such policies will be investigated and resolved appropriately.

Any employee who has any questions or concerns about these policies should talk with his/her Department Head, the City Secretary, the Assistant City Administrator, or the City Administrator.

Finally, this policy should not, and may not, be used as a basis for excluding or separating individuals of a particular gender, or any other protected characteristics, from participating in business or work-related social activities or discussions. In other words, no one should make the mistake of engaging in discrimination or exclusion in order to avoid allegations of harassment. The law and policies of the City prohibit disparate treatment on the basis of sex or any other protected characteristic with regard to terms, conditions, privileges and perquisites of employment.
