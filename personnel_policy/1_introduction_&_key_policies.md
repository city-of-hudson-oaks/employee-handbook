### 1.1 Introduction {#1-1-introduction}

This Employee Handbook is designed to acquaint you with the City of Hudson Oaks (the “City”) and provide you with information about working conditions, employee benefits, and some of the other policies affecting your employment. You are expected to read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the Employee Handbook. It describes many of your responsibilities as an employee and outlines many of the programs provided by the City to benefit employees. (Eligible employees will be given additional information about the City’s various benefit programs.)

The policies set forth in this Employee Handbook are not intended to create a contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations of any kind or a contract of employment between the City and any of its employees. The provisions of the Employee Handbook have been developed at the discretion of City officials and, except for its policy of employment-at-will, may be amended or canceled at any time, at the City&#039;s sole discretion. The policies in this Employee Handbook supersede all prior written and/or oral City policies. If you have any questions about any of the City’s policies, please ask your supervisor, your Department Head, or the City Administrator.

The policies in this Handbook are established by the Hudson Oaks City Council and any amended, revised, or new policies must be approved by the Council. These policies apply to all City employees unless specified otherwise by the policy itself, by State or Federal law, or official City Council action.

A copy of the Employee Handbook shall be issued to each City employee, whether full or part-time status. Department Heads and supervisors are required to be knowledgeable and familiar with the policies contained in this Handbook.This Handbook shall supersede all previous publications of the Hudson Oaks Personnel Policy Manual. Each employee shall sign a form acknowledging receipt of this policy and the signed form shall be retained in the employee’s personnel file.

### 1.2 Management Authority {#1-2-management-authority}

It is the policy of the City, pursuant to Ordinance 2007-02, that the general and final authority for personnel administration rests with the City Administrator, except for matters reserved to the City Council by State law. The City Administrator may, at his or her sole discretion, delegate authority to appropriate staff members to act on his or her behalf. Department Heads are responsible for the proper and effective administration of these policies within their respective departments. Individual City departments may develop policies and procedures that are consistent with City policies and procedures found in this Handbook, subject to review and approval by the City Administrator. No such departmental rule or policy is effective until approved in writing by the City Administrator. A copy of all departmental rules and policies will be filed with the City Secretary. In the event of any conflict between department rules and policies and this Employee Handbook, the policies in the Handbook will control.

### 1.3 Employment At Will {#1-3-employment-at-will}

Employees who do not have a written, individual employment contract, approved by the City Council and setting forth a specific, fixed term of employment, are employed at will. This means that no individual supervisor has the authority to enter an employment contract with any employee. As an at-will employee, either the employee or the City may terminate the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, without notice or cause.

### 1.4 Equal Employment Opportunity Act {#1-4-equal-employment-opportunity-act}

The City of Hudson Oaks is firmly committed to providing employees with a work environment where all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. No officer or employee of the City shall discriminate in employment practices based on race, creed, color, religion, veteran status, national origin, sex, age, or the existence of a physical or mental disability. This equal opportunity policy of the City applies to all areas of employment, including, but not limited to recruitment, hiring, job assignments, pay, training, promotions, privileges, and conditions of employment.
