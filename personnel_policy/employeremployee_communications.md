## 7. Employer/Employee Communications {#employer-employee-communications}

### 7.1 Employee Relations {#7-1-employee-relations}

The City believes that the work conditions, wages, and benefits it offers to employees are competitive. If employees have concerns about work conditions or compensation, they are strongly encouraged to voice these concerns openly and directly to their supervisor. Experience has shown that when employees deal openly and directly with supervisors, the work environment can be excellent, communications can be clear, and attitudes can be positive. The City makes every effort to amply demonstrate its commitment to employees by responding effectively to employee concerns.

### 7.2 Public Relations {#7-2-public-relations}

Employees must take care to separate their personal roles from their positions with the City when communicating on matters not involving City business. Employees must not use City employee identification, stationery, supplies, or equipment for personal or political matters.

When communicating publicly on matters that involve City business, employees must not presume to speak for the City on any topic, unless they are certain that the views they express are those of the City, and it is the City’s desire that such views be publicly disseminated.

When dealing with anyone outside the City, including public officials, employees must take care not to compromise the integrity or damage the reputation of either the City, or any outside individual, business, or government body.

Providing high quality service to the public in a timely, accurate, efficient and courteous manner is primary objective of each City employee and official. Each employee represents the City when in contact with the public, and employees must constantly strive to be good-will ambassadors for the City. Any employee who fails to demonstrate the proper level of courtesy and professionalism will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

In all matters relevant to the City, employees must make every effort to achieve complete, accurate, and timely communications by responding promptly and courteously to all proper requests for information and to all complaints.

In serving the citizens, always remember the following:

\(A\) City employees’ jobs are dependent on the citizens of Hudson Oaks;

### 7.12 Performance Appraisals {#7-12-performance-appraisals}

The purpose of the City of Hudson Oaks performance pay policy is to encourage personnel to perform to higher standards by rewarding those employees who exceed expectations, as determined through the annual evaluation process, with a percentage increase to their base salary in addition to the cost of living adjustment.

**METHODOLOGY**

**Evaluations. **Employees will be evaluated on an annual basis through the means of an evaluation instrument. The evaluation will serve as the official method for communicating job performance to the employee. During the annual review period, the employee and the evaluator will set goals and establish objectives to be reached during the course of the following year. Supervisors will hold a mid-year review with their employees to determine if the goals and objectives identified are realistic, or if additional goals and objectives are needed. Evaluations will be conducted annually during the month of August. The mid year review will be conducted annually during the month of February.

**Performance Assessment Reports.** Throughout the year, personnel job performance will be assessed through Performance Assessment Reports \(PAR\). The PAR will allow managers to address performance issues throughout the year and also provided a means to document exemplary performance. A PAR should be used any time an employee does something above and beyond their normal job performance expectations. It should also be used to document any behavior that is below normal job performance expectations. The PAR’s are essential in the monitoring and effectiveness of the evaluation instrument throughout the year and should be used as a means to assist the evaluator during the annual review period and the mid year review.

**Performance Improvement Plan.** If during the annual review period, during the mid-year review or at any other time during the year, an employee’s job performance falls below expectations, the City of Hudson Oaks will enter into a Performance Improvement Plan \(PIP\) with that employee. The PIP is a document that is used to clearly identify the job performance issue, map out a strategy to address the resolution of the issue and to establish a time frame in which to resolve the issue. If at the end of the time period established for issue resolution, the employee’s performance has not improved, additional measures may be taken up to and including termination. The employee’s immediate supervisor will develop the PIP with input from the employee. The department head or department manager must review and sign the PIP for it to be considered valid.

**Termination without Performance Improvement Plan.** Some employee actions may result in immediate termination. Such events include, but are not limited to: theft, gross negligence and actions unbecoming a City of Hudson Oaks employee. The City Administrator must approve the termination of the employee if progressive discipline, including a PIP, was not used to correct the employee’s performance.

**MERIT PAY INCREASE**

The evaluation instrument and the PAR constitute the only method in determining whether or not an employee is eligible for a Merit Pay Increase \(MPI\) in addition to the across the board cost of living adjustment \(COLA\). The City Administrator, based on the recommendation of the department head or division manager, will have oversight and final approval of all MPI recommendations.

The amount of the MPI will be determined based on the outcome of the annual evaluation and shall take effect on January 1, of the following year. The following classifications will be used when determining the amount of the MPI:

| **CLASSIFICATION** | **MPI** | **COLA** | **TOTAL** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exceeds Expectations | 3.0% | 2.0% | 5.0% |
| Above Expectations | 2.0% | 2.0% | 4.0% |
| Meets Expectations | 1.0% | 2.0% | 3.0% |
| Below Expectations | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% |

_\(MPI + COLA = Total percentage salary increase for following calendar year\)_

Council will establish actual COLA and MPI percentages during the budget process. Actual percentages may be greater or less than the proposed values based on Council direction and budgetary constraints.

The above classifications are defined as follows:

**Exceeds Expectations.** In general, an employee who exceeds expectations has received three or more PARs documenting the exemplary nature of the action undertaken by the employee throughout the year. Additionally, the employee has completed all goals and objectives as identified in the evaluation instrument and mid year review for the review period ending. The employee must not have received a negative PAR during the review period ending. The employee must not have been placed on a PIP within the past two years.

**Above Expectations.** In general, an employee whose performance is classified as above expectations has received one or more PARs documenting the exemplary nature of the action undertaken by the employee throughout the year. The employee has completed all goals and objectives as identified in the evaluation instrument, but may not have completed new goals and objectives as established in the mid year review. The employee must not have received a negative PAR during the review period ending. The employee must not have been placed on a PIP within the past year.

**Meets Expectations.** In general, an employee whose performance is classified as meeting expectations may or may not have received one or more PARs documenting the exemplary nature of the action undertaken by the employee throughout the year. The employee may or may not have completed all goals and objectives as identified in the evaluation instrument, but has completed all goals and objectives as adjusted in the mid year review. The employee must not have received more than two negative PARs during the review period ending. The employee must not have been placed on more than one PIP during the review period ending, and the outcome of the PIP must have resulted in the employee correcting their behavior as identified in the PIP.

**Below Expectations.** In general, an employee classified as performing below expectations has received more than two negative PARs during the review period ending. The employee may or may not have completed all goals as identified in the evaluation instrument. The employee has been placed on one or more PIP during the review period ending, the outcome of which may or may not have resulted in the employee correcting their behavior. More than one classification as below expectations in a two-year period may result in the immediate termination of the employee.

The above definitions are not meant to prohibit department heads or division managers from developing additional clarifications for the performance classifications, but any additional clarification must include the core elements defined above, and any additional clarification or adaptation of the above must be reviewed and approved by the City Administrator before taking effect.

### 7.13 Employee Appeals Policy {#7-13-employee-appeals-policy}

The City provides employees with a process for appealing certain matters to their Department Head and/or the City Administrator. Matters not specifically mentioned in this policy are not appealable. The City provides most employees with two levels of appeal. The first level appeal is to the employee’s Department Head. The second level appeal is to the City Administrator.

**Appealable Actions.** Employees may appeal the following:

\(A\) Annual performance evaluations if the employee is rated below expectations overall - appealable only to the Department Head.

\(B\) Allegedly unlawful treatment;

\(C\) Disciplinary action involving an unpaid suspension of at least 1 day or 1 shift \(or more\), demotion, reduction in rate of pay, or termination.

**Appeal Form.** All appeals must be written and submitted to the employee’s Department Head on the City’s appeal form. The appeal form must be fully completed, including employee’s signature and date, before the appeal will be considered. Any documentation relevant to the appeal must be attached to the appeal form, including: copies of applicable policies, rules or regulations; names of individuals involved in the action and date it occurred; the adverse action taken or the alleged unlawful treatment complained of; the remedy sought; and any other information or documentation relevant to the appeal.

**Time Limits for Filing Appeal.** An employee wishing to make an appeal must submit a fully completed appeal form to his or her Department Head within five business days of the act giving rise to the appeal. If an employee fails to file his or her appeal by the deadline, the employee waives his or her right to appeal.

**First Level of Appeal.** All appeals are initially heard by the employee’s Department Head. First level appeals to the Department Head are informal and are conducted in a meeting format with the employee and his or her supervisor\(s\) in attendance. If, during the meeting the Department Head finds that he or she needs additional information in order to make a determination, the Department Head may suspend the meeting for up to five business days. The Department Head will reschedule the appeal meeting at a time mutually agreeable to both the employee and the City. The Department Head will provide the employee with a written decision \(on the original appeal form\) within five business days of the conclusion of the appeal meeting.

**Second Level of Appeal.** If an employee is unsatisfied with the outcome of the first level of appeal, the employee may pursue a second level of appeal to the City Administrator. To request a second level of appeal, the employee must submit a copy of the employee’s original appeal form to the City Administrator’s Office within five business days of the employee’s receipt of the Department Head’s first level appeal decision.

Unless waived by the employee, within ten business days of receiving the notice of appeal to the City Administrator, the Human Resource Coordinator will schedule the appeal hearing. The employee may be represented by another employee of his or her choosing during the second level appeal. The City and the employee will each be afforded an opportunity to present evidence and witnesses to assist the City Administrator in making an informed determination. If the City Administrator decides he or she needs additional information in order to make a determination, the City Administrator may suspend the hearing for up to five business days to obtain the information. The City Administrator will then reschedule the appeal meeting at a time mutually agreeable to both the employee and the City.

Requests for other City employees to testify at an appeal hearing with the City Administrator must be made in writing to the City Administrator within a reasonable time \(at least five business days\) prior to the scheduled hearing. The Human Resources Coordinator will coordinate attendance by witnesses who are employees of the City. Employee witnesses who participate in an appeal hearing will be compensated at their regular rate of pay. Except under unusual circumstances, employees who are not scheduled to work at the time of the appeal hearing will not be required to attend.

The City Administrator will provide the employee with a written decision \(on the original appeal form\) within five business days of the conclusion of the appeal hearing. The decision will include the following:

\(A\) recap of details of the incident\(s\) giving rise to the appeal;

\(B\) reference to any applicable rules, regulations, policies, procedures, laws, etc., relevant to the appeal; and

\(C\) the decision, along with the appropriate action to be taken, if any.

The decision of the City Administrator is final.

**Frivolous Appeals.** An unreasonable number of appeals filed by an employee or group of employees which are designed to thwart the City’s orderly processing of appeals, or which are patently irrelevant or incomprehensible, as determined in the City Administrator’s sole discretion, will be rejected as “nonappealable.” Employees involved in the filing of such appeals may also be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

**Upper Management Appeals.** Where an appealable action is initiated by a Department Head, the appeal of such action shall be to the City Administrator. In this circumstance, there shall be only one level of appeal, which shall conform to the above procedures established for a Second Level of Appeal and the decision of the City Administrator is final. Where an appealable action involving a Department Head is initiated by the City Administrator, there shall be no right to appeal and the decision of the City Administrator shall be final.
