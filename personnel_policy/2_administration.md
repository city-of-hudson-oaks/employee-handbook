## 2\. Administration {#2-administration}

### 2.1 Job Descriptions {#2-1-job-descriptions}

Each Department Head is responsible for creating and updating written job descriptions for each position within the Department, and providing a copy of each job description to the City Administrator or his/her designee. All job description must be written in a standard format adopted and approved by the City Administrator. The City Administrator will periodically review the duties and responsibilities of each position within the City and set pay levels commensurate with the duties and responsibilities, skill and educational requirements and experience level associated with each position.

### 2.2 Employment Categories {#2-2-employment-categories}

It is the intent of the City to clarify the definitions of employment classifications so that employees understand their employment status and benefit eligibility. Each employee is designated as either nonexempt or exempt from federal and state wage and hour laws. Employees are informed of their status as exempt or nonexempt at the time of their initial employment, or subsequently, if their classification changes for any reason. The City Administrator will receive written notification of any change in an employee’s status as exempt or nonexempt.

**Nonexempt Employees.** Nonexempt employees are subject to the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Nonexempt employees (other than certain police department employees) are generally entitled to overtime pay for all hours actually worked in excess of 40 in a 7- day work week, under the specific provisions of federal and state laws.

**Exempt Employees.** Exempt employees are those who are not covered by applicable wage and hour laws found in the Fair Labor Standards Act. Accordingly, exempt employees are not entitled to overtime compensation for work performed beyond 40 hours in a work week. Exempt employees are expected to put in the number of hours necessary to complete their assignments in a timely and quality basis.

In addition to the above categories, each employee will belong to one of the following employment categories:

**Regular Full-Time Employees.** Regular full-time employees are employees who have completed their probationary period, are not in a temporary or part-time status, and who are regularly scheduled to work 40 hours or more per week. Generally, regular full-time employees are eligible for the City’s benefit package including annual leave, sick leave and holiday pay, subject to the terms, conditions, limitations, and waiting periods of each benefit program. Regular full-time employees are required to participate in the Texas Municipal Retirement System (TMRS).

**Regular Part-Time Employees.** Regular part-time employees are employees who have completed their probationary period, are not assigned to a temporary status, and who are regularly scheduled to work less than 35 hours per week. Regular part-time employees do not accrue vacation or sick leave. If Regular part-time employees are normally scheduled to work a holiday, they will receive holiday pay. Regular part-time employees who work at least 1000 hours in a year, are eligible to participate in TMRS.

**Temporary Employees.** Temporary employees are employees whose employment is scheduled to last less than six months; who hold seasonal positions, even though the employment may last more than six months; hold a position which, by City policy and practice, is intended to give introductory work experience to a person preparing for entry into the work force; or are in a position scheduled to work 40 hours per week but on a temporary basis. Employment beyond any initially stated period does not in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees retain that status unless and until notified of a change in writing by the City Administrator or his/her designee. While temporary employees who work directly for the City (as opposed to a temporary staffing agency) receive all legally mandated benefits (such as workers&#039; compensation insurance coverage and Social Security), they are generally ineligible for the City’s other benefit programs. In addition, temporary employees have no right to appeal disciplinary action. Temporary employees who are placed with the City, but who are actually employed by a temporary staffing agency must look to the temporary staffing agency to determine what benefits they are provided. Such employees are not eligible for benefits from the City and are not eligible for participation in TMRS.

**Volunteers.** Volunteers are not employed by the City in any capacity. Volunteers chose to donate their time and services for the benefit of the community without any expectation of compensation or benefits.

### 2.3 Basic Employment Qualifications {#2-3-basic-employment-qualifications}

In addition to the qualifications applicable to each position, an applicant for employment with the City must:

(A) be at least 18 years of age or meet special age requirements for the police department;

(B) be of good moral character;

(C) have a social security number;

(D) be a citizen of the United States or possess a valid resident alien work card;

(E) agree to be fingerprinted when applicable to the position;

(F) not be addicted to the use of narcotics or alcohol;

(G) not have received a dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces.

### 2.4 Proof of Employment Eligibility and Identity {#2-4-proof-of-employment-eligibility-and-identity}

The City is committed to employing only those individuals who are authorized to work in the United States and who comply with the requirements of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). Under IRCA, each new employee, as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9 Form) and present legally acceptable documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility. This must be done within 3 days of beginning employment. Failure to provide the necessary documentation within 3 days will result in termination of employment. Former employees who are rehired must also complete an I-9 Form if they have not completed an I-9 Form with the City within the past 3 years, or if their previous I-9 Form is no longer retained or valid.

### 2.5 Employment of Relatives/Nepotism {#2-5-employment-of-relatives-nepotism}

No member of the same household of a City Council Member, the Mayor, the City Administrator or a current Department Head will be employed by the City. No person related within the second degree by affinity (marriage) or within the third degree by consanguinity (blood) to the Mayor, any member of the City Council, the City Administrator or any current City employee may be appointed to any office, position, or other service of the City. (See Attached Chart)

### 2.6 Personnel Records {#2-6-personnel-records}

Important events in each employee’s history with the City will be recorded and kept in the employee’s official personnel file. Performance reviews, change of status records, commendations, disciplinary actions, and educational and professional attainment records are examples of records maintained in your file.

Employees must promptly inform the Human Resource Coordinator of any changes in name, address, home phone number, and family status (births, marriage, death, divorce, legal separation), and name and address of dependents (for benefits and tax withholding purposes only), beneficiary designations, persons to be notified in an emergency, educational accomplishments, and relevant certifications or licenses. This responsibility also applies to employees on leaves of absence.

The City relies on the accuracy of information provided by individuals in their resume and employment application, as well as other data provided throughout the hiring process and during employment. Any misrepresentations, falsifications, or material and/or purposeful omissions in any of this information may result in the exclusion of the applicant from further consideration for employment or, if the person has been hired, termination from employment.

Personnel files of employees are the property of the City and access to the information they contain is restricted. However, access to the information in an employee’s personnel file may be subject to disclosure in accordance with the Texas Public Information Act.

### 2.7 Other Employment {#2-7-other-employment}

The City does not wish to control the personal affairs of its employees or regulate their personal time. However, because outside activities such as holding a second job may interfere with, or detract from, an employee’s work on behalf of the City, work for other employers is strongly discouraged in most instances. Employees will not be permitted to hold another job (including self-employment and volunteer work) that might discredit the City, result in a conflict of interest (or potential conflict of interest) or result in anything less than a satisfactory performance of the employee’s regular and normal duties on behalf of the City. Other outside activities that similarly distract from an employee’s ability to satisfactorily perform his or her job with the City are also discouraged. Before engaging in self-employment or accepting employment with another employer, the employee must obtain the written authorization of their Department Head or the City Administrator. A copy of the authorization will also be filed with the Human Resources Department to be maintained in the employee’s personnel file.

Under no circumstances may an employee on FMLA leave, sick leave, disability leave, or workers’ compensation leave, work another job (whether for pay, as a volunteer or as self-employment), unless expressly authorized in writing by the Department Head and the City Administrator.

### 2.8 Emergency Closing {#2-8-emergency-closing}

Except for extraordinary circumstances City offices do not close because of bad weather or other emergency. In the event of inclement weather, employees are expected to use their good judgment and are asked not to take unnecessary risks. If you feel that you are unable to drive due to weather conditions or are otherwise unable to get to work because of the weather, you must call your supervisor. (You must make this call no later than the time you would normally leave home for your commute to work, or as otherwise directed by your Department.) The City may then make arrangements to provide you with alternate transportation to transport you to and from work.

Under certain circumstances, the City Administrator may close certain departments, or various operations within a department. If the City Administrator makes the decision to close City offices, affected employees will have an excused absence with pay. If the employee’s department is not officially closed, absences due to weather will not be excused and any employee who fails to report to work will be charged vacation time for the day(s) missed. If an exempt employee has no accrued vacation time, he or she will be required to make up the missed time at a later date. If a nonexempt employee has no accrued vacation or compensatory time available, he or she will not be paid for the time missed.

Many City departments provide essential services and employees are required to report to work regardless of adverse weather or other conditions. Essential personnel are designated by the City Administrator and/or Department Head. Essential personnel who fail to report to work may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Police, or other essential personnel will be required to report to work when other City departments are officially closed due to weather or other type of extraordinary circumstances.

### 2.9 Training {#2-9-training}

From time to time, the City offers training to its employees to enhance or acquire new skills for the performance of their jobs or future advancement. Training may include seminars, institutes, in-house training, and courses offered for credit at local colleges/universities. Department Heads or supervisors may require employees to participate in appropriate training from time to time. Employees may also request that they be allowed to participate in appropriate training. Work load, training topic and appropriateness to job duties, budget constraints, cost of training, and other factors will be considered by the City in determining if requested training will be approved.

**Time Spent in Training.** Time spent by nonexempt employees attending mandatory training will be considered work time and employees will be compensated. Attendance at training, lectures, meetings, etc., will not be counted as working time if:

(A) Attendance is voluntary;

(B) The employee’s Department Head did not approve the training, prior to the employee’s attendance;

**Prior Authorization.** All requests for outside training must be approved in advance by your Department Head.

### 2.10 Purchasing Procedures {#2-10-purchasing-procedures}

When an employee’s position requires spending City funds or incurring any reimbursable personal expenses, that individual must use good judgment on the City’s behalf to ensure that good value is received for each expenditure. City funds and all assets are for City purposes only and are not for personal benefit. This includes the personal use of the City’s assets such as tools, equipment and computers, for example.

Employees authorized to make purchases on behalf of the City must follow the procedures outlined in the City purchasing procedures or as approved by the City Administrator.

### 2.11 Travel and Reimbursement {#2-11-travel-and-reimbursement}

It is the City’s policy to pay for, or reimburse all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by an employee when traveling on City related business in accordance with this policy, except for meals and incidental expenses (M &amp; IE). Meals and Incidental Expenses shall only be paid on a per diem basis and in accordance with the rates established by the U.S. General Services Administration for the current fiscal year (www.gsa.gov). If neither the city nor the county is listed, then the standard CONUS destination rate will apply.

Itemized receipts are required for all expenses, except for meals and incidental expenses. Receipts must be an itemized copy from the vendor and not just the credit slip or balance due. Failure to submit itemized receipts will render those expenses non-reimbursable. Employees should use the most economical means of travel available when expending City funds.

**Request to Travel.** Whenan employee travels on behalf of the City, a Travel Request Form must be completed by the employee and submitted for approval to the Department Head; Department Heads must obtain approval for their own travel from the City Administrator. The travel request must be submitted as soon as the need for travel is known. All travel on behalf of the City must be approved prior to any expenses being incurred.

**Request for Advance Funds**. Employees are typically provided with a City issued purchasing card to pay for expenses associated with City travel. In instances where a purchasing card is not made available, an employee needing an advance of funds must, except under emergency circumstances, complete and submit a written request for an advance of funds at least ten business days before the advance is needed. All advancement of fund requests and deviations from the above policy must be approved by the City Administrator.

**Employee Expense Report Form.** An Employee Expense Report must be completed for all travel, even when a procurement card is used to pay for expenses. The form must include the purpose of the trip, the destination (city and state), and the departure/return dates and times. All receipts and supporting documents must be attached to the Employee Expense Report.

Receipts should be affixed in date order to an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper and attached to the Employee Expense Report, and then forwarded to Accounts Payable after being reviewed and signed by the Director.

**Approving Authority.** All travel and meeting documents, requests for travel, requests for advance of funds, and requests for reimbursements (with supporting receipts), must be approved as follows:

(A) The Department Heads shall be responsible for approving their employees’ travel. The CityAdministrator is the final approving authority for Department Heads’ travel.

(B) All travel documents must be submitted to the employee’s Department Head or the City Administrator, as applicable.

(C) All spouse and/or family member’s travel expenses must be paid by the employee.

(D) Only the actual cost of reasonable and necessary business related expenses incurred by the employee on behalf of the City will be reimbursed.

**Transportation.** The City has the option of requiring that travel be made in a City-owned vehicle. When a City vehicle is not furnished, the City will reimburse the employee at the current allowable IRS reimbursement rate per mile or the cost of a round-trip coach/economy airline ticket, whichever is appropriate, plus other stated costs (_i.e._, parking at airport and ground transportation at destination). A receipt(s) is required for reimbursement.

Employees receiving a vehicle allowance are not eligible for mileage reimbursement unless the destination is greater than 50 miles in one direction.

**Hotel/Motel Reimbursement.** Employees will be reimbursed for the actual cost of lodging in a hotel/motel that is appropriate for the particular meeting or purpose of the trip. A receipt(s) is required for reimbursement. The room rate must be pre-approved by the employee’s Department Head, or in the case of a Department Head, approved by the City Administrator. Overnight stays will only be authorized for travel to destinations in excess of 60 miles from the City, unless otherwise approved in writing by the City Administrator.

**Meal Reimbursement.** The City of Hudson Oaks provides a per diem for meals and incidental expenses. The per diem rate is the rate published by the U.S. General Services Administration for the current fiscal year.

**Compliance.** Abuse of this policy, including falsifying expense reports or submitting false claims, will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### 2.12 Professional Memberships and Subscriptions {#2-12-professional-memberships-and-subscriptions}

The City may elect to pay for all or a portion of an employee’s professional memberships and subscriptions. Requests for payment (or reimbursement) of such expenses must be submitted on forms provided by the City and approved by the City Administrator. Approval must be obtained in advance and will be based on such factors as available funds, the relationship of the membership and/or subscription to the employee’s job duties and the number and/or cost of other memberships and subscriptions paid by the City for the employee.

### 2.13 Probationary Employees {#2-13-probationary-employees}

All newly hired or rehired employees hired to fill a regular position and employees who have been promoted must satisfactorily complete a probationary period. During an employee’s probationary period, the employee has no appeal rights _for disciplinary actions._ Temporary employees do not serve a probationary period and have no appeal rights. Only those employees who meet acceptable performance and other standards during their probationary period will be retained as employees. If an employee successfully completes his/her probationary period he/she is still employed at the will of the City; the employee will, however, have a right to appeal disciplinary action, as set forth in the City’s Employee Appeals policy.

**Probationary Periods.** Probationary periods are as follows:

A six-month probationary period will apply for all newly hired or promoted employees, including police personnel.

Any extensions to a probationary period must be approved jointly by the Department Head and the City Administrator.

Employees are required to successfully complete their probationary period (and any extensions thereof) before they are eligible for transfer or promotion unless otherwise approved by the City Administrator.

During this time, the employee has no right to appeal disciplinary actions.

**Disciplinary Probation.** Employees may also be placed on disciplinary probation for up to 180 days. In addition, employees who receive a below standards annual performance evaluation will be automatically placed on disciplinary probation for 90 days.

**Failure of Probation.** An employee will fail probation if, in the judgment of the Department Head, the employee’s performance is unacceptable. Failure of probation can occur at any time within the probationary period. Department heads are responsible for ensuring adequate documentation of all cases of failure of probation as well as counseling, training and other efforts to help employees improve their performance during their probationary period.

The City endeavors to provide a safe work environment for all employees. It is the responsibility of each employee to maintain the standards of physical and mental health fitness required for performing the essential functions of his or her position, either with or without a reasonable accommodation.

**Conditional Employment.** In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the City may condition employment on an individual’s providing certain medical history and/or successful completion of a medical examination. The Human Resources Department, working with Department Heads, designates those positions requiring medical history, a physical examination and/or a psychological examination.

**Medical Exams for Current Employees.** A Department Head may require a current employee to undergo a medical examination to determine fitness for continued employment following an injury or accident. With the prior approval of the City Administrator, a Department Head may require a current employee to undergo a medical examination to determine fitness for continued employment for promotion or for other personnel action; as may be necessary for the City to provide a reasonable accommodation; and as otherwise permitted in accordance with federal and state law.

With the prior approval of the City Administrator, a Department Head may require a current employee to undergo a psychological evaluation as part of an administrative action for an employee showing behavioral signs of distress or impairment or when mental instability is reasonably suspected. The signs should indicate that the behavior of the employee:

(A) Poses a threat to self and others; or

**Medical Records.** The City is firmly committed to protecting the privacy rights of its employees. To ensure that employees’ privacy rights are protected, the following is intended to provide guidelines for the appropriate handling of medical records:

Medical related information (i.e., results of medical examinations and post-offer inquiries, workers compensation disability reports, the physician’s portion of the Family and Medical Leave Act Forms, etc.) must be kept in a locked file separate from the personnel files. The Human Resources Department should designate a specific person or persons who will have access to the medical file. An employee’s medical related information must be kept confidential and only those individuals having a business need to know will be informed of medical related information for an appropriate business/management purpose. Officials who have access to such information are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information. In addition, supervisors, managers, and others included in making and implementing personnel management decisions involving employees with medical conditions should strictly observe applicable privacy and confidentiality requirements.

Should a department have a need to request additional information from a physician concerning an employee’s medical condition and the impact upon the employee’s ability to perform the essential job functions, this request should be made in writing to the employee. Essential job functions forms are available from the Human Resources Department.

Email should not be used to communicate regarding confidential personnel matters including medical/health related matters.

### 2.16 Background Checks {#2-16-background-checks}

The City will perform background checks on applicants and employees to the extent necessary to determine their eligibility for employment or ongoing employment, as the case may be. Background checks may include, but are not necessarily limited to, review of criminal conviction record; verification of educational degree, license, or certificate required for the position; review of driving record; drug testing; outstanding warrant check; and credit history. The extent of the background check will be consistent with the employee&#039;s position and duties. The City may also conduct periodic background checks on existing employees. As a condition of employment or continued employment, applicants and employees are required to give the City the necessary authorization to perform such checks.

### 2.17 City Driver Requirements {#2-17-city-driver-requirements}
